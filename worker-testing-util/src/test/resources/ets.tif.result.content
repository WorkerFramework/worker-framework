3.6. The effect of environmental tobacco smoke
in two urban communities in the west of
Scotland
°wits P.. dtuas, tuviz J. HOLZ, VICTOR M. HARrTNORNZ AND PZTT-R Bons
INTA0bvc-noN
The qui:riot, of whether environmental
tobacco smoke (En) can damage health has
not yet been ckarly answered. It is known that
a lighted cigarette emits more sidestresm
smoke dull mainstream Ind chit the smoke
avs.gable for involuntary inhalation contains
substantial amounts of carbon monoxide, tar,
nieorine, bertro(s)pyrene and other circi-
nogens, and oxides of nitrogen (1).
Studies from Japan (2) and Greece (3) have
suggcned that non-smoking wives of heavy
smokers have a two-fold increased risk of lung
cancer when :err:sued with non-smoking
warm of non-smokers. Its contrast, analysis of
data horn the prospective study of the Ame-
rican Cancer Sociery volunteers (4) has sug-
gested that very little, if any, increased risk of
lung cancer mires when non-smoking women
married to smoking husbands and non-
smokers married to non-smoking husbands are
compered.
The present study has been carried out in a
defined population group in an sees of high
incidence (5) of lung cancer with a precisely
defined population 1.•sse.. It seports lung cancer
data OA both males arid females,
WATTALIALS ATM itZTMODS
The study comprises 16,171 apparently healthy
individuals aged between 45 and 64, resident
in Renfrew and Paisley, two urban anus in the
Vest of Scotland. They took pan in • multi-
phasic screening survey for cardiortspirtterry
disease between 1972 and 1976. This rept-
sente6 a response rite of SO % of thou ran-
dorniy sampled from the resident population.
ot this survey have been elescr,...ed by
VMS (6). Information on esch respondent's
smoking habits and their experience of symp-
toms of respirttory and cardiovascular disease
were collected using a self-completed ques-
tionnaire, carefully checked at the rime of
attendance at the screening unit.
The diagnosis of cancer in each individual
has been checked in the West of Scotland
Cancer Registry and follow up tar mortaiiry
carried out by record linkage (7) with data from
the Registsr General for Scotland. Follow up
is complete until 31 December 1981
As members of the same household attended
the screening unit, it was possible to identify
smoking and non-smoking psrtners of smokers
and non-smokers - The.se were allocated to
categories defined so u to represent an
ine-reuing measure of tobacco exposure_

Fcmitle mortality is shown in Table 6. All
causes enortsliry LI higher in the group exposed
to ETS then in the controls. This vu not the
cue for lung cancer although mortality from
myocardial infarction was higher in the group
exposed so ETS when compared with the con-
trols.
Division oral! diseases into those considered
smoking and non-smoking related (8) pro-
ducecI a higher rite its the group exposed to
ETS when compared with oontrols.
On account of the apparently unusual rela-
tionship berween lung CLICGT risk and tobacco
consumption in the Welt of Scotland (9) the
amount smoked by individuals in the defined
categories is shown in Table 7. In the smoking
group also exposed to ETS 57.3 % of males and
53.4 % of females smoked more than 15 ciga-
rettes per day. This compares with 41.8 % of
males and 46.5% of females in the smoking
group.
DISCUll I 0 PI
Insufficient time has elapsed since the comple-
tion of the recruitment phase of this study
(1976) for sufficient numben. either of inci-
dent cases of cancer or of other diseases, to
allow firm conclusions to be based on the
results. The results have been expressed is
annual sge standardised rites per 10.000,1., the
tots] number of incident cum and the number
of deaths is smell in the control and ETS expo-
sure groups (Tables 5, 6).
The results relate to only 8,128 of the 16,171
individusls who attended the multi-phasic
screening unit (50 %). Some of This disc r cps ricy
cars be accounted for by those living alone,
chose living with a partner outwith the age
range, and those living with a partner who has
nor mended. Those who have been el-
12.5
smokers for five years or more were also
elecluded from the usalysis. As there is full
doubt whether these groups account for the
total discrepsncy, given an initial resporue rate
of 80 %, the authors require to continue their
investigation of this apparent discrepancy.
This study has unique futures which allow
even preliminary result, to be of interest
These are:
1. The study has been carried out in an arts
with the highest national incidence rate of
Jung canter recorded (5).
2. It is s prospective cohort study carried out
in a geogriphically defined population
whose members are homogeneous by socisl
clus and ethnic group.
3. Other reports (2, 3, 4) concentrate on
females. This study includes both KW.
4. No questions concerning exposure to ETS
were asked, thus avoiding the bias inherent
In self-reported assessments of partnership
dosage.
Given the strength of the epidemiologicd
association bc,rween cigarette smoking and
lung cancer, it is this disease rather than
ischaemic heart disesse that would be first to
appear in excess in the cohort ifs dose response
relationship existed, especially as the respon-
dents were all apparently healthy at the time of
screening.
In males, the eases of lung cancer isecwring
in non-smokers were found mom frequently in
those exposed to ETS (4/310) than in the con-
troh '.2/517) (Table 5). No dose•response rela •
tionship was apparent in females for lung
cancer deaths though an effect was present
when all smoking related (8) deaths including
deaths from rnyocirditl infarction were taken
into amount (Tabie 6).
These findings may be supported to an
extent by the dose-response relstionship that
exist.. for self-reponed respiratory symptoms

(Tables 2,3), all of whicb am more frequently
reported in the group exposed to EIS than in
the controls and four Of which aellieve statis-
tical significance
The number of deaths in the control arid
En apart= groups is very small and may
explain the Lack ciao apparent dose-response
In krnales. Herwrvite, m the relative risk kr
lung ca.neer foe active enokesa mock higher
In males than ksinaleS h may be ton early to
expect many keemits in the ETS exposure
group to be affected. This would also apply to
talk as well
as female deaths from myocardial
infarction.
Oempiriot5 has not been taken into account
in this analysis, as in effect on lung cancer risk
In eon-smokers is thought to be marginal (4,
10).
The West of Scotland is a valuable area to
continue examination of the effect of ETS on
account of the relttively high rate of lung
Cilleer in non-smokers and the flattening of the
dose-response relationship above an average
consumption of 20 cigarenea per day (9).
In conclusion, thc clear dose-response rela-
tionship with lung cancer obierved in males
crposed
to ETS supports observations from
previous studies. Although the number of
deaths on which the current analysis is based is
small. The nature of the finding, makes conti-
nuation of this study important.

There is still controversy about the relationship between cigarette
smoking and female lung cancer.The mortality rate of female lung can-
cer in Tianjin is the highest in Ihina(25.3/105).The female scokinz
rate in Tianjin is nlso the higheSt in Chine.:herefore we *ad con-

the smokers. The thought remains that they might have reduced fur-
ther if in fact some final non-smokers were true smokers. This seems a
genuine possibility since information for 48 of the 134 cases was pro-
vided by the daughter or son and for 36 by another informant, as
opposed to 16 CaSCS where the subject, and 34 where the husband,
provided the data.
(iii) Following from this second point, when results were broken down by
type of informant there was no real evidence of an association with
ETS when information was obtained from the subject or the husband.
A positive relationship was seen only when information was obtained
from a daughtei, son or another informant (see Table 2.25). Since the
daughter, son and other informant are likely to have provided less
reliable data — they may never have known the subject had smoked —
the results are doubtful.
Overall, the results do not provide convincing evidence of a relation-
ship to ETS exposure, despite the painstaking care with which the study
was undertaken.

never smoked, a significant (p < 0.05) relationship was reported between
smoking by the husband and risk of lung cancer (Table 2.26).
Elsewhere in the same paper, a relative risk of l.86, with confidence
limits of 1.04-3.5, is cited apparently for the same relationship. Risk of
lung cancer was also reported to increase with the number of cigarettes per
day smoked by the husband and by years of exposure to husband's smok-
ing.
There are a number of difficulties in interpreting the results from this
study. These include:
(i) No information is given on how the control group was selected,
although it is noted that it did not differ from the casts on age, edu-
cation, occupation, race, marital status, birthplace and residence, and
56G405045

44 Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Mortality
that the proportion of smokers in thc controls was similar to that in
the Tianjin female population.
(ii) No information is given on where the interviews were carried out or
whether the questions were always answered by the respondent.
(iii) No definition of 'non-smoking' is given, so it is unclear whether the
non-smokers really arc lifelong never smokers.
(iv) The number of women considered in Table 2.26 is identical to that
given elsewhere in the paper for the total number of non-smokers.
Clearly, analysts relating to husband's smoking should be limited to
married women, but this does not seem to be the case.
(v) It is not explained why different relative risk estimates are given for
what purports to be an identical analysis.
(vi) A positive relationship of lung cancer risk to various occupational
exposures, to a history of lung diseases, and to cooking with coal is
shown, but no attempt is made to determine whether any of these
factors correlates with husband's smoking or to adjust for them in the
analysis relating risk to husband's smoking
2.4.10 New Mexico Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer - Humble I
Humble et al. [69] used the New Mexico Cancer Registry to identify 724
lung cancer cases occurring during 1980-84. Interviews were conducted
with 64l of these, 305 with the cases themselves and 336 with a spouse,
child or other relathe. Controls were obtained mainly by random tele-
phone sampling, but for the older age groups an extra group of people
taken from a roster of Medicare participants was used. Controls were sam-
pled to have the same distribution of age and ethnicity as the cases, and
784 of 944 selected controls were interviewed.
The questionnaire identified 8 male and 20 female never smoking
cases and 130 male and 162 female never smoking controls. Risk of lung
cancer in relation to the spouse ever having smoked cigarettes, pipes or
cigars is given in Table 217. Humble et al. report that the elevated risk
in relation to spouse smoking was not materially affected by considering
an index based only on cigarette smoking by the spouse, by adjusting for
age or ethnicity, or by considering results separately for self- and surro-
gate-reported cases. No clear trends were seen when results were consid-
ered as a function of duration of exposure or amount smoked by the
spouse.
The study is not a good one for a number of reasons summarized
below:

Much interest has been expressed in the past several
years in the reported relationship of involuntary or
passive smoking and the development of lung cancer.
Hirayama if i, in a prospective stud' in Japan. reported
a 2:1 RR for nonsmoking women married to smokers as
compared to the RR for nonsmokers married to non-
smokers Trichopoulous et a). (2). in a studs in Greece.
found that nonsmoking women with husbands who
smoked had an OR about 2.5 times as high as that of
w•omen with husbands who never smoked. and the OR
rose to 3.4 in women whose husbands smoked more than
one pack of cigarettes a day. In another case-control
study. Correa et al. (.3) found nonsmoking women
married to smokers with a lifetime consumption of 41 or
more pack years had an OR 3.5 times as high as the OR of
women married to nonsmokers.
In an analysis of data from the American Cancer
Society's prospective study, Garfinkel 44) found little if
In) increase in RR of lung cancer for nonsmoking
women married to smokers (4). The RR was 1.54 for lieu
smokers and 1.10 for those whose husbands smoked 20 or
more cigarettes a day. Kabat and Wynder (3) in a pilot
stud) found no extra lung cancer risk in women and in
nonsmoking men exposed to smoke at home, but
nonsmoking men exposed at work showed a slight
increase in risk. Kabat and Wynder measured exposure
both by the spouse's smoking habit and the subject's
report of direct exposure.
An investigation by Sandler et al. (6) Of relatively
young cancer cases in North Carolina found an overall
1.6 OR (smokers and nonsmokers) for exposed vs.
nonexposed cancer cases. Exposed cases were those in
which the husband smoked. Exposed nonsmokers had a
higher OR than that of exposed smokers. In nonsmokers
the OR. were elevated and statistically significant for
cancers of the cervix, breast. and endocrine glands.
Occurrence of cancer in the latter two sites previously had
not been associated with cigarette smoking. Lung lancer
also showed an elevated OR but was not statistically
significant: however, the number of cases was small.
Two papers in Hong Kong by Chan and Tung (71 and
by Koo et al. (8) show very little difference between cases
and conuols with respect to involuntary smoking and
lung cancer.
Except for the two prospective studies, all of these
studies were based on relatively few lung cancer cases in
female nonsmokers; the number of cases ranged from 22
to 77 in various case-control studies.
In a previous paper. we poinred out that in any stud%
of involuntary smoking and lung cancer, categorizing
nonsmokers by the smoking habit of the spouse may lead
to error in classification of exposure. In the United States
particularly. there may be many women, married to
nonsmokers, who are exposed to the smoke of others at
work or in other areas. Conversely, some individuals
married to smokers may suffer acute effects from inhaling
smoke and consciously avoid such exposure. A survey of
38.000 subjects by Friedman et al (9) confirmed this
hypothesta. About 40% of women nonsmokers and 50% of
men nonsmokers who were married to nonsmokers were
exposed to the smoke of others for some periods of time
during a week. and 47% of nonsmoking women married
to smokers repotted that they were not exposed to tobacco
smoke at home. In the studs reported here, we record the
smolt:rig habit of husbands (total No of cigarettes
smoked and No. smoked at hornet, as well as the number
of hours a day the subjects were exposed to the smoke of
others at home, at work, and in other areas.
Other causes for concern are establishment of the
microscopic diagnosis of primary lung cancer and

verification of the smoking history. In a study of the
histologic type of lung cancer in relation to asbestos
exposure. 49 of 774 men and women with a discharge
diagnosis of microscopically proved lung cancer were
recorded as nonsmokers in the hospital chart (101. After
review of hospital records. histologic sections. and
interviews, only 10 cases remained who had died of
primary lung cancer and who had never smoked. One-
half of the others had smoked at some time and, one-hall
the confirmed nonsmokers had. primary cancer other
than that of the lung.
It is apparent, therefore, that more studies on in-
voluntary smoking are needed, with particular attention
given to obtaining microscopic proof of primary lung
cutter and more detailed information about exposures to
cigarette smoke.
METHODS
To have available enough subjects for a case-control
study of Involuntary smoking, we obtained access to the
records of 4 hospitals-3 in New jersey and 1 in Ohio. In
each of these institutions. we identified all lung cancer
cases in women recorded during 197141. In 2 hospitals
she cases were selected horn the Tumor Registry: in I
hospital. they were selected horn the surgical index in the
pathology department; and in the other hospitals, records
from the pathologs laboratory were checked against the
medical records diagnostic discharge index. No case was
selected that had been diagnosed prior to 1971. Cases with
cancer of the colon-rectum served as controls. Colon-
rectum cancers have been shown in epidemiologic studies
not to be related TO cigarette smoking. Charts then were
located and reviewed Cases that were diagnosed clinically
only or by cytolop , or as sarcoma or lymphoma of thr
lung. were excluded Those that occurred in smokers for
ex-smokers), according to hospital records, also were set
aside. Only those charts in which the patient was
specified as a nonsmoker, or in which the smoking habit
was not recorded. were further investigated.
MI the slides for these cases and controls were pulled
from the files tan average of 0.15 slides/case) and were
reviewed blind by 0. A.). In a small sample. slides for
cases and controls were reviewed a second time to check
consistency of the findings. Another sample of slides for
smokers with lung cancer, and for subjects with diagnoses
of sites other than lung or cnIon-rectum, also were
selected for histologic review and were mixed in with
the slides of nonsmokers. If slides were missing or not
available, or of too poor quality for accurate diagnosis.
the blocks for the one were lamed and new slides were
prepared.
An interview based on a standard questionnaire was
obtained for all cases and controls, along with Micro-
scopic pool. The interview was with the woman if she
were still alive or with next of kin if she had died.
Seven interviewers did all the questioning; three did
interviewing in all 4 hospitals. About three-quarters
of the interviews were with she patient or with spouse
or children. All other informants had known the sub-
JNct vok 75. WO s. stersasta Ins
ject for at least 25 years and were able to supply the
necessary information. All interviews were reviewed
by the supervisor. When the information was incomplete,
another respondent was contacted. A second interview
was obtained In about 10% of the cases and controls.
Women who had never married and who lived with
another member of the family were classified according
to their relative's smoking habits. Therefore, the word
"husband" as used in this- paper means husband or
cohabitant living in the same household. Of the cases.
57% were married and living with their husbands at the
time of the cancer diagnosis. The interview included
questions on current smoking habits of the husbands of
the cases and controls up to the present time Of to the
time of death; on the number of cigatettes smoked per day
at home, and the number of years they had smoked. The
interviewer also asked about the average number of hours
a day the woman had been exposed to the smoke of others
at any time during the past 5 years, during the past 25
years at home, while at work and in other areas. and
during her childhood. Women whose husbands smoked
cigarettes only occasionally were counted as not exposed.
occasional exposure at home, work, or in other areas also
was counted as not exposed.
We matched 1 lung cancer case to 3 colon-rectum
cancer cases. Controls were matched to within 5 years of
age and were from the same hospital. In most age groups
there were many colon-rectum cancers in women of the
same ages for matching purposes The colon-rectum
cases were checked for histologic proof in the same was as
were the lung cancer cases, and the smoking interviews
were obtained by the same interviewers who obtained the
lung cancer interviews. The interviewers were not told
the diagnoses, nor did they know the hypothesis of the
study.
Several cdifferent analytic procedures were used: The
Mantel-Haenstel procedure for obtaining a point estimate
of the OR with a 1:3 match was employed, as adapted by
Pike and Morrow Ur ), with CL as shown by Miettinen
(12). To compare subgroups of exposures. the matching
was broken, and OR and CL were computed by the
Mantel-Haensiel method. In addition, a logistic regres.
sion model was used, with estimation and testing
procedures as given by Breslow and Da s 03).
To permit comparison with previous studies. the
subjects' exposures to cigarette smoke were classified in

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the proems through which data for 154
cases of lung cancer in nonsmoking women were
obuined from the four hospitals. Of 1.175 women
listed as having lung cancer, 892 (76%r were smokers or
had smoked in the past. according to hospital records. 01
the 283 remaining women. 36 (12.7%) were proved
histologically to have other than lung cancer upon

husband's total smoking as a check of the validity of
exposure to husband's s.molce and was &raved by sub-
tracting the number of cigarettes smoked at home from
the total number of cigarettes the husband smoked per

DISCUSSION
In a previous paper (4) the problem of classifying
involuntary smoking on the basis of the husband's
smoking habit was discussed. It was pointed out that
questions directed at ascertaining a quantitative estimate
of the number of hours 3 day that subjecu were exposed
might be a better measure than the total number of
cigarettes that the husband smoked. inasmuch as not all
of the husband's smoking was done at home. In the
present study weclassified the exposure both ways; by the
number of hours per day the subjects were exposed to
smoke of others and by the husband's smoking habits.
We also recorded the respondent's estimate of how many
cigarettes a day the husband smoked at home. In this
group of women, husbands who smoked cigarettes
smoked art average of 27 cigarettes a day, of which 11.5
cigarettes on average (43%) were smoked at home. Of
course, all cigarettes smoked at home were not necessarily
smoked in a room where the subject could have been
exposed. In this study. the husband's smoking at home
was related to the women's lung cancer. whereas number
of hours of exposure a do to all sources of tobacco smoke
was not related.
A potential source of error was the hospitals report of
whether the subject smoked or not. In this stud.. 40% of
the women with lung cancer, classified as nonsmokers (or
smoking not stated; on the hospital recotd, were smokers
at some time liable 1). Another 13% did riot have primary
lung cancer. It is apparent, therefore, that in any study of
involuntary inhalation and lung cancer, the smoking
histories of the subjecu have to be confirmed as well as
the extent of their involuntary exposures Smoking
histories of husbands were obtained for the 113 women
who were smokers. The distribution by smoking habit is
shown in table 9. As we might have expected, smokers are
more likely to be married to smokers than are non-
smokers. The table shows that 43 of 134 women. or 32.1%,
of the cases included as never smoked in this studs had
husbands who never smoked; but only 21 of 113. or 18.6%.
of women who smoked and were mistakenly classified as
nonsmokers in the hospital record had husbands who did
not smoke. Among the controls only 8.5% of women who
were called nonsmokers (or smoking was not sutedi were
smokers.
The table shows the effect on the OR, when one
assumes that 8.5% of the additional controls needed for
the 1:3 match had husbands with the same smoking
distribution as the husbands of cases who were smokers.
and that the balance had the same distribution as that of
the 402 controls included in the study. The OR for the
husband's smoking increase to 1.61 overall and are as
high as 1.63 for the 20-39 cigarette a da. smokers and 2.32
for the women whose husbands smoked 40 or more
cigarettes a day. For exposure to the husband's smoke at
home. the OR are 1.66 overall. 1.53 for women whose
husbands smoke 10-19 cigarettes a da.. and 2.85 for those
whose husbands smoke 20 or more a do at home. Thus
the inclusion of women whose smoking habits have not
been reviewed greatly increases the OR

The classification used in this study might be criticized
because some women married to ex-smokers could be
counted in the same exposure category as a woman
exposed to smoke up to the time of hekfinal illness.
However. all patients who have gone through diagnosis
arid treatment for lung cancer had some period of time
when they were not exposed to others smoke, either
before or after treatment. We believe that the classifica-
tion we used was indicative of the "usual amount of
smoke to which the person was exposed." To determine
the experience of a "'pure" norsexposed group, 17 cases
and 56 controls in this study were identified who were not
exposed to the smoke of others during the last 5 years,
during the last 25 years, whose husbands never smoked at
home or elsewhere. and who never were exposed to smoke
in their childhood. These cues and controls were
compared with all other subjects. The OR was 1.34 (CL:
0.81. I.59t.
In conclusion, we found an elevated risk of lung
cancer, ranging from IS to 51%. in women exposed to the
smoke of others. although the increase was not stasis-
ticallv significant. The women who were married so
smokers of 40 or more cigarettes a day Or who were
exposed to the smoke of at least 20 cigarettes a day at
home showed a risk twice as high as that of women not
exposed at all. This result is consistent with the dose.
response risk of exposure to the husband's smoke shown
in some case-control studies (7, 3i. A dose-response
relationship was confirmed in a logistic regression
analysis. The lack of a relationship when exposure was
classified by hours exposed to smoke of others may have
occurred because this variable does not accurately mea-
sure intensity of exposure. There is no consistently

Or by exposure at home or at work. Exposure in other
areas carried a higher OR, but this finding is difficult to
interpret.

In the study by  Kabat and Wvp_d561, lung
cancer pacicnu in six cities were identified. and
controls were matched to the CaSCS on age. sex,
rac,c, date of interview and hospital. More care
seems to have been taken in this study than in
the others to ensure that subjects classified as
non-smokers were truly such. Interviewers used
a standardized questionnaire, but it is unclear
whether they were blinded to the status of the
patient as a case or a control.
The study of Builler eta]. p-ri was conducted
in six coastal counties in Texas. Little infor-
mation is provided about such key features of
the study as the criteria for classifying the
spouse as a "regular smoker" or not, whether
ex-smokers were included or excluded, whether
the interviewers were blinded, and the number
of patients for whom a surrogate interviewer
was required.
Garfinkel et o/.158Lstudied cases and controls
from hospitals in New Jersey and Ohio. Con-
trols were patients with colorectal cancer,
matched to the cases on age and hospital. The
interviewers were kept blinded to the status of
each patient. Women were counted as unex-
posed to ETS even if their husbands smoked
cigarettes "only occasionally." There was exten-
sive reliance on surrogate interviewees, many
with questionable knowledge about the patient:
approximately one quarter oral) interviews were
with someone other than the patient, the spouse
or a child, about 60% were with the spouse or
a child, and only 12% were with the patient
herself.
The case-control study by, Wu et of., 59),
conducted in Los Angeles County, was the
first to use neighborhood rather than hospital-
ized controls. Only cases who were still alive
were interviewed (all on the telephone); i.e. no

surrogates were permitted for cases who had
died or who refused to be interviewed. No
information was provided as to whether the
interviewers were blinded. The point estimate of
the OR. given by the authors in their paper's
abstract and in the text on p. 748, OR = L2, is
inconsistent with the confidence interval re-
ported in both of those places, 0.5-3.3 (the
geometric mean of the Limits must equal the
point estimate). Instead of working with these
incorrect values, we used in Table 2 and in Fig.
2 of this paper the values for "spouse smoked"
for adcnocarcinoma in their Table 2: OR = 1.2,
with a 95% confidence interval extending from
0.6 to 2.5.
Brownson et al. [601 carried out their
case-controlstu y nZ-nrWter. The controls were
patients with cancer of the colon or bone mar-
row and were matched according to age and sex
(there was approximately a 50:50 split on sex
for the patients with lung cancer). The inter-
viewer 11/2.5 blinded to the case or control status
of the patient. The interviewee was someone
other than the patient (mainly the spouse but
occasionally a sibling or child) for nearly 70%
of the cases and almost 40% of the controls.
Exposure to ETS was not dichotomized in their
Table 4 a.s "none" vs "any" but as "less than
four hours per day" vs "four or more". The
95% confidence interval for the OR there
should extend from 0.46 to 6.10 (personal com-
munication from the senior author).
The study by  Humble et al. [61] was a poRu-
lation-based case-control study in New Mexico.
Controls were obtained by random digit dialing
or from a randomly generated list of Medicare
recipients. They were selected to match the
frequency distributions of the cases on sex,
ethnicity and age. The patient's status as a
never-smoker was checked against the infor-
mation recorded in the hospital chart. More
than half of the time a surrogate was relied on

40 Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Mortality
An interesting feature of Gao's first paper is that a number of signifi-
cant associations of lung cancer risk with factors other than smoking were
reported. Risk was found to be increased in those with previous tubercu-
losis, pneumonia and emphysema, in those with a high [sic] consumption
of carotene-rich foods, in those who used rapeseed rather than soybean oil,
and in those who reported stir frying, deep frying or boiling more often,
and eye irritations or house smokiness more frequently when cooking. No
information was provided as to whether such factors were associated with
ETS exposure, or whether standardizing for them affected the reported
relationship of ETS to lung canter.
2.4.8 New Jersey/Ohio Case-Control Sizzdy of Lung Cancer — Garfinkel II
Garfinkel et al. [67] described results from a case-control study carried out
in one Ohio and three New Jersey hospitals. The main analyses compared
ETS exposure among 134 non-smoking female lung cancer cases and 402
non-smoking female colorectal cancer controls. The cases and controls
were drawn from a larger number of cases and controls diagnosed during
the period 1971-81. Subjects with no reported smoking history in hospital
were originally selected. Repeat interviews were then carried out with the
subject if still alive, or with the next of kin or other informant who had
known the subject for at least 25 years. Subjects found to have smoked
were excluded, as were those found not to have lung cancer on review of
the histology, the objective being to include only definite never smokers
with definite cancer of one of the two types. Of 283 women originally
selected as lung cancer cases with no evidence of smoking from hospital
records, 113 (40%) were found to be smokers on re-interview, while 36
(13%) were proven.histologically not to have lung cancer.
Controls were matched 3:1 for age, hospital and interviewer, the inter-
viewer being blind both to the diagnosis and to the objective of the study.
A range of different indices of ETS exposure was used, relating to exposure
from others generally, from the husband (including cohabitant if never
married), at home, at work, in other areas, and during childhood. Periods
of exposure were also investigated. Analyses were standardized or matched
for some or all of age, hospital, socio-economic status, and year of diagno-
sis, and a wide range of relative risks was presented.
As shown in Table 2.23, no significant relationship of risk to type of
exposure regardless of level was seen, although some of the 11 estimates
came close to a positive relationship. There were some cases, however,

where risk was significantly elevated in thc group having the maximum
level of exposure (where a significant dose-related trend was also seen)
In considering the findings from this large and carefully conducted
study, three points are particularly relevant
(i) The problem of multiple testing and the role of chnnix In the paper
there were almost 100 estimates of relative risk presented with 95%
confidence limits, 7 of which were significantly positive and 7 signifi-
cantly negative. Although there were more odds ratios greater than 1
than less than I, it is not clear bow these results should be interpreted.
The authors did not even comment on the significant negative rela-
tionships, sonic of which were highly significantly negative, e.g. rela-
tive nsk of 0.46, with 95% limits of 0.38-0.55 for smoke exposure
during the last 25 years when the respondent was the husband.
(ii) The possibility that bias duc to misclassification of smoking habits
might still have existed. Garfinkel et al. present data in relation to two
indices of ETS exposure separately for subjects finally classified zn
non-smokers (included in the main results) and for true smokers (ex-
cluded after screening). The results, summarized in Table 2.24, show
that the relative risk estimates reduced dramatically after excluding

the smokers_ The thought remains that they might have reduced fur-
ther if in fact some final non-smokers were true smokers. This seems a
genuine possibility since information for 48 of the 134 cases was pro-
vided by the daughter or son and for 36 by another informant, as
opposed to 16 cases where the subject, and 34 where the husband,
provided the data.
(iii) Following from this second point, when results were broken down by
type of informant there was no real evidence of an association with
ETS when information was obtained from the subject or tbc husband.
A positive relationship was seen only when information was obtained
from a daughter, son or another informant (see Table 2.25). Since the
daughter, son and other informant are likely to have provided less
reliable data — they may never have known the subject had smoked —
the results are doubtful.
Overall, the results do not provide convincing evidence of a relation-
ship to EFS exposure, despite the painstaking care with which the study
was undertaken.

Shanghai Cancer Immure, Shanghai. People's Republic af Chirea, 1Nationa1 Cancer Institute, Bethesda. MD 20892. USA: and
• Shanghai Chest Hospital. Shanghai. People's Republic of China,
A cue-control study involving interviews with 02 female
lung cancer patients and 73S population-based controls was
conducted to investigate the high rates of lung cancer, notably
adenocarcimarna. among women in Shanghai. Cigarette smok-
ing was a strong risk factor, but accounted for only about one-
fourth of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Most pa-
tients, particularly with adenocarcinoma, were life-long non-
smokers. The risks of lung cancer were higher among women
reporting tuberculosis and other pre-existing lung diseases.
Hormonal factors were suggested by an kw:teased risk associ-
ated with late menopause and by a gradietst in the risk of
adenocarcinorna with decreasing menstrual cycle length, with
a 3-fold excess among women who had shorter cycles. Perhaps
most intriguing were associations found between lung cancer
and measures of exposure to cooking oil vapors. Risks in-
creased with the numbers of meals cooked by either stir
frying, deep frying or boiling; with the frequency of smokiness
during cooking, and with the frequency of eye irritation dur-
ing cooking. Use of rapeseed oil, whose volatiles following
high-temperature cooking may be mutagenic, was also re-
ported more often by the C.114Cer patients. The findings thus
confirm that factors other than smoking are responsible for
the high risk of lung cancer among Chinese women and pro-
vide clues for further research. inching the assessment of
cooking practices,
The age-adjvated annual lung cancer incidence rate among
females in Shanghai during the 1970's and 1980's has been
about 20 per 100,000 pooulation, one of the highest rates in
China and in the world (ltheinal Cancer Control Office. 1980.
Gao. 1982: Waterhouse et al . 1982, Shanghai Cancer Regis-
try. 1983). Elevated lung cancer death rates have also been
observed among Chinese women in other pans of the world,
including Hong Kong (Kung et al . 1984: Koo et al.. 1985).
Singapore (MacLennan et al.. 1977) and the Untied States
(Fraumeni and Mason. 1974, Hinds et al.. 1981. Gime and
Brophy. 1982) The high rates of this cancer are sarpresing
since lets Chinese womea smoke cigarettes (Deng and Gala,
198%. Furtheernoie. In Shanghai (Vier) and Gao, 1986) and
elsewhere. hospital records have indicated that most of the
lung tumors are adenocarcinornas a is pe of lung cancer less
strongly related to smoking (Lubin and Blot. 1984). To esplore
reasons for the high rates of lung carfeer among wailer in
Shanghai. the Shanghai Cancer Institute, in collaboration wtth
the US National Cancer Institute, carried out a population-
based case-control etieeltieation. Herein we report the results
of this study. quantifying the role of smoktng and evalosting a
variety of suspected risk factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
All newly diagnosed cases of primary lung cancer (9th
Revision ICD 162) during the 2-year period February 1984-
February 1986 among female residents of urban Shanghai aged
35-69 years were liemitied by a rapid reporting system for
lung cancer establelhied for this study. The system was bath
upon the exams Shanghai Cancer Registry, the oldest in
China (Gao. 1982). Trained staff contacted medical facilities
in Shanghai to ascertain new cases. so that triterviews could
be rapidly scheduled (typically within 2 weeks of diagnosis)

tumor within the lung. Two sensor pathologists and 4 senior
clime inns were appOireed to vet-sew the diagnostic information
from all cases collected in the study, including X.ral.
cytologic and histologic slides.
Female controls were randomly selected within 5-sear age
strata from the general population of the Shanghai urban area
The number and age distribution of the controls were deter-
mined in advance from the number and age distribution of
long cancer cases reported to the Shanghai Cancer Registry

Cigarene smoking
Cigarette smoking was associated with a significantly In-
creased risk of lung cancer, even though only 35% of the lung
cancer patients (compared to 18% of the towels) had ever
smoked. There was a 3 3-fold excess nsk (95% Cl = 2.5-
4.2) of lung cancer among smokers, but risks were higher for
squarrious-cell carcinoma (RR = 7.2. 95% CI = 4.6-11-1)
and oat-cell cancer (RR = 7.2. 95% Cl = 3.6-17.0) than for
adenocarcinoma (RR = 1.5. 95% CI -- 1.0-2.1). The RR for
an Lung cancers combined tended to rise with increasing *am-
bers of clearectes smoked per day and with mates:rig duession
of soreilung (Tette !). The excess reached 14-fold for ferages
who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day for more than 30
years. Similar trends existed for adenocareinorna and for squa-
mous/oat-cell cancers, but the magnitude of the increase was
considerably greater for the latter (not shown 1.
We calculated populatxm-attributable risk (PAR) estimates
for smoking in each age group The PAR MSC with age, from
8% 10 27% to 28% to 40% at ages <55. 55-59. 60-64. and

smoking rose with age. In total, we estimated that 24% of all
female lung cancers in Shanghai were due to smoking.

other lung diseases, we excluded non-malignant lung (incases

cluded Further analysis (not shown) indicated that the effect
of rubereolosis was not related to the use of isoniazid or
streptomycin. While tuberculosis and pneumonia were related
to both squamousioat-cell carcinoma and adcnoearcinoma of
the lung. emphysema and chronic bronchitis were associated
only with the squarnous- and oat-cell types
Cooking practices

cooking in Shanghai. with over 95% of women reporting the

DISCUSSION
The high incidence of lung cancer among women in Shang-

factors While claim smoking was an important cause of

howeser. there was an upward trend in risk associated with

Hong Kong (Koo etal., 1983). The risks of lung cancer among
Shanghai women increased, however, with various measures
of exposure to cooking oil vapors. These included the number
of different dishes prepared per week by either stir frying.
deep frying, or boiling: the frequency of eye irritation when
cooking: and the smokiness of the house when coating. In
Chinese wok cooking, regardless of the method used. oil is
usually poured into a wok and heated to high temperatures
before meat or vegetables are added Even boiling may email
sume exposure to cooking oil vapors, since oil is often added
to the water before heating. Consequently, the living quarters
may become smoky during cooking. with opportunity for
exposure to inhalable cooking oil vaptigs.
The plausibility of the hypothesis that lung cancer may be
related to cooking oil vapors. partieularly from rapeseed oils
used in Shanghai. is enhanced by recent experimental investi-
gations. In one study the mutagerncity of products from cook-
ing oil was assayed by the Ames test (Qu et al.. 1986). The
extracts of condensed volatiles of rapeseed oil, refined rape-
seed oil, and soybean oil heated at about 170C were all
positive in tester praiit TA98 activated with $9. The mutage-
may of the extract front rapeseed oil vat/inks was stronger
than that frorn soybean oil vOlitdes There was no evidence of
mutageoicity in the oils themselves. either heated or unheated.
lri another study. the extracts of condensed volatiles of rape-
seed oil enhanced the yield of micronuclei in polychromatic
elythrocres of the bone marrow of mice, with a clear dose-
response relationship, reflecting damage of chromosomes and
ecU gelsoioxicity by rapeseed oil volatiles (Chen. 198'4. Al-
though these MIS often correlate with carcinogenic potential,
no bioassay studies have yet been earned out, to our knowl-
edge. If the effect of rapeseed oil smoke on lung cancer
incidence is real, the problem is of great importance to popu-
lations of eastern scrotal China and *Met =gas of the world
what the oil is often used for cooking. Chinese rapeseed oil,

ences. 19811. in COMMA to rapeseed ad with <2% ern= acid
(Canbra oil), which was recently approved for sale in the
United States (Federal Register, 1985).
Several studies have shown that the risk of lung cancer is
elevated by a low intake of foods containing vitamin A. partic-
ularly as Us precursor beta-carotene (Coking et al., 1987)
AllbOugh reported mainly in Western couftmes, this associa-
tion has also been noted among Chinese women in Singapore
(MacLennan eral. 1977). However, we found no evidence of
a protective effect among women in Shanghai. where intake
tit fresh, carotene-rich, dark green vegetables is high by world
standards. In fact. a positive association was observed between
carotene intake and lung cancer risk in females (in contrast to
no association in males). We have no ready explanation for
this unusual finding in females, which was observed also in a
case-control study of lung cancer in Hawaii (Hinds et al .
1984). However, the protective effect of carotene-rich foods
was mainly confined to current smokers in one large•scale
study (Ziegler et , 1986). and thus the effect may be less
evident in Shanghai where few women smoke.
A clue to hormonal factors was suggested by an association
between menstrual cycle length and lung adenixarcanoina. A
3.fold differee.ce in adenCearCiaorna risk was (00611 among
Shanghai wixnen 'entitling shoat < 26 days: compared to long
( >33 days) menstrual cycles, with only a weak trend tor
squamous- and oat-cell cancers. A relation of short menstrual
cycles to breast cancer risk has been suggested in data from
Sweden (Olsson etal., 1983) and. to a !ester extent, the United
States (Sherman er at.. on) Some increases in lung adeno-
carcinoma risk were also asaecialed with but menCiplese and
with a high estimated total number of frieflill'Ual cycles among
women aged 55 and over having a natural menopause. A role
of hormonal factors is also Suggested by the observation that
among non-smokers adenocarcinoma affects proportionately
more females than males (Lubin and Blot, 1984), and by the
findings of estrogen and progesterone receptors in some lung
SelefeCiftenOrnaS of women (Chaudhuri et at.. 19$2). We
discovered no relation to oral contraceptives or replacement
estrogen therapy. but use of these compounds among women
in the study group was rare in Shanghai. It seems unlikely that
the menstrual patterns of Chinese women contribute greatLy.to
their high lung cancer risk. bui the internal consistency of the
trends suggests that future studies of lung cancer in China arid
elsewhete should examine endoctme hypotheses in more detail
This large populaUon-basod case-control study of furl Can-
cer in urban Shanghai has conformed that cigarette smoking is

2.4.7 Shanghai Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer — Gao
Gao et al. 1651 identified 765 female lung cancer cases aged 35-69 in urban
Shanghai in 1984-86.43% of which were diagnosed by tissue biopsy, 38%
by cytology and 19% by X-ray. Interviews were conducted with the 672
who were still alive, and also with 735 population-based controls selected
to have a similar age distribution to the cases. Some further details air
given in a later paper by Gao et al. [66], where it is noted that 435 of the
cases and 605 of the controls had never smoked cigarettes on a regular
basis for as long as 6 months ('non-smokers').
The results relating to ETS reported in the earlier paper are not clearly
presented. The authors note first that no significant increase in risk was
observed for overall exposure to ETS during childhood (relative risk, 1.1:
95% confidence limits, 0.7-1.7) or in adult life (relative risk, 0.9, 95%
confidence limits, 0 6-1.4)', but do not make it clear whether these results
relate to all women or only to never smoking women. 1 hey then present a
table (Table 2.22) 'which indicates that 'lung cancer risks among non-smok-
ing women tended to increase with the number of years a woman lived
with a husband who smoked', but do not make it cleat whether or not the
first category in this table includes women married to non-smoking hus-
bands. Consideration of the number of cases and controls compared with
the total suggests such women have been excluded, but how many such
women there were is not known, nor is any answer offered to the question
whether ETS exposure was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer
among women who have never smoked_ It is also unclear to what extent the
trend apparent in the table may have resulted from incomplete adjustment
for age, bearing in mind the strong correlation or age both with risk of lung
cancer and with years smoked by the husband.

40 Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Mortality
An interesting feature of Gao's first paper is that a number of signifi-
cant associations of Lung cancer risk with factors other than smoking were
reported. Risk was found to be increased in those with previous tubercu-
losis, pneumonia and emphysema, in those with a high [sic] consumption
of carotene-rich foods, in those who used rapeseed rather than soybean oil,
and in those who reported stir frying, deep frying or boiling more often,
and eye irritations or house smokiness more frequently when cooking. No
information was provided as to whether such factors were associated with
ETS exposure, or whether standardizing for them affected the reported
relationship of ETS to lung cancer,
2.4.8 New Jersey/Ohio Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer — Garfinkel II
Garfinkel et al. [671 described results from a case-control study carried out
in one Ohio and three New Jersey hospitals. The main analyses compared
ETS exposure among 134 non-smoking female lung cancer cases and 402
non-smoking female colorectal cancer controls. The cases and controls
were drawn from a larger number of cases and controls diagnosed during
the period 1971-8 Subjects with no reported smoking history in hospital
were originally selected. Repeat interviews were then carried out with the
subject if still alive, or with the next of kin or other informant who had
known the subject for at least 25 years. Subjects found to have smoked
were excluded, as were those found not to have lung cancer on review of
the histology, the objective being to include only definite never smokers
with definite cancer of one of the two types. Of 283 women originally
selected as lung cancer cases with no evidence of smoking from hospital
records, 113(40%) were found to be smokers on re-interview, while 36
(13%) were proven hisiologically not to have lung cancer.
Controls were matched 3:1 for age, hospital and interviewer, the inter-
viewer being blind both to the diagnosis and to the objective of the study.
A range of different indices of ETS exposure was used, relating to exposure
from others generally, from the husband (including cohabitant if never
married), at home, at work, in other areas, and during childhood. Periods
of exposure were also investigated. Analyses were standardized or matched
for some or all of age, hospital, socio-economic status, and year of diagno-
sis, and a wide range of relative risks was presented.
As shown in Table 2.23, no significant relationship of risk to type of
exposure regardless of level was seen, although some of the 11 estimates
came close to a positive relationship. There were some cases, however,

Fontham et at. 11) have recognized that the misclassifi-
cation bias may have resulted in biased overestimates of
the relative risk of lung cancer due to passive smoking or
exposure to ETS.' That indeed such misclassification oc-
curs is highlighted in the findings of Tontham etal., who
reported individual urinary cotinine/creatinine values as
high as 14,014 rig/mg in one group of presumably never-
smoking controls and as high as 5,163 num in another
group of controls. While nonsmokers typically have such
urinary values below 10 nding, Fontham et at. used a
cutoff value of MO ngjrng to eliminate from the reported
never-smokers those who very likely did not belong in
that class. '
In their study, Fontham et al used two kinds of
controls for their female lung cancer cases: women who
had colon cancer and women chosen from the general
population. In .principle, a passive-smoking investigation
should be limited to never-smoking women and, if the
actual smokers in the study could be eliminated, the
resulting estimate of the relative risk due to passive
smoking would be the more valid.
For lung cancer cases, next-of-kin information was
obtained in 34% of instances, yet for only 10% of colon
cancer controls. The possibilities for bias due to this alone
could be extravagant. But that use of next-of-kin infor-
mation leads in turn to yet another source of bias: urinary
cotininejcreatinine determinations could not or were not
nude for women for whom next-of-kin information was
obtained. There were 134 such lung cancer cases but
only 32 such colon cancer controls.
As it turned out, the urinary cotininefcreatinine val-
ues were much more moderate for the lung cancer cases
than for colon cancer or for population controls. Only
two lung cancer cases were excluded for being above
the cutoff value of 100 ng/mg, those two being at 131
and 219 ngimg. Of the 260 colon cancer controls for
whom such biochemical determinations were made,
seven were above the critical value, their values ranging
from 145 to 5163 ng/mg, while among 684 population
control biochemical detteminations, 14, ranging from
103 to 14,014 nerng, were above the 100 nears critical
level.

'the abbrewatiors used is. EIS, environmental tobacco Smu6
To see how this would bias the estimated relative
risk, consider that we removed all the current or ex-
smokers from among the presumably nonsmoking con-
trols, but none of those from among the lung cancer
cases. The misclassification bias would then be worse
than if we did nothing, and to an extent that is true if we
make such exclusions more certainly Prom among con-
trols than from among lung cancer taws. And to the
extent that Fontham et at have worked, by trying to
correct for it, that the miscbssification bias exists, they
are conceding that the apparent increased risk due to
EIS could be artificial.
'to go on: the report by Fontham etal. gives me fresh
cause for concern. To bring out an increased relative risk
from ITS, these investigators switched their attention
from all lung cancers to only adenocarcinomas of the
lung. No separate attention was focused on other lung
cancers, particularly not on squamous cell carcinomas.
If these investigators have had their choice of which
type of lung cancer to emphasize, their statistical signifi-
cance levels should be modified to take the multiple.
testing aspect into account. Apparem statistical signifi-
cance at the 0.05 level would no longer be at the 0.05
level. And even so, the individual comparisons made by
Funthain et at are not statistically significant, it was only
by going to trend tests, admittedly a sensible approach,
that statistical sigmkance could be achieved.
For household exposure to EIS the relative risk of
1.38 for adenocarcinoma would be reduced to 1.21 for
all lung carcinomas. That of 1.43 for more than 30 years
of household exposure relative to adenocarcinoma
would be reduced to 1.25 relative to all lung carcinomas.
Even the sigitilicant trend test with P = 0.03 would
become nonsignificant at P = 0.14 if such reemphasis
were made.
With the bulk of the lung carcinomas found being
adenocarcinoma.(281 of 159 by review diagnosis, 244 of
359 by hospital diagnosis), this reduction in the level of
significance with the addition of the squamous cell and
ether lung carcinomas lends itself to an unusual interpre-
MOO. It may well be that for these other lung cancers
not only are they not associated with ETS, they may even
be negatively associated with US. And these others,
particularly squamous cell carcinomas, are just the ones
most strongly associated by Olen with ETS.

Dr. Mantel focuses attention on the urinary cotinine
values of the relatively few controls (21 of 944) who
reported themselves to be nonsmokers but who were
probably active smokers. The fact that these individuals
svere identified and excluded from the analysis can only
be considered a strength of the study. The distribution
of cotinine values in this study is quite similar to those
reported in the 10-country collaborative study by; the
International Agency for Research on Cancer of self-
report and biochemical indicators of ETS exposure (1). In
that study, 1.9% of the reported nonsmokers had urinary
cotinine/creatinine values above 100 ng/mg, compared
to 1 99% in our study (0.8% of lung cancel rases. 2.7%
of colon cancer controls, and 2.0% of population con-
trols). The lower proportion of cases with connme levels
above 100 ng/rng as compared io colon cancer controls
or population controls may well be a result of the prior
medical record reviews and. physician query used to
screen out 'ever smokers' from the lung cancer case and
colon cancer control series. The information was more
commonly available from these sources for patients with
lung cancer than with colon cancer, and a larger propor-
tion of potential cases were excluded as ineligible prior
to obtaining either interview or uriiie specimen. Among
eligible study subjects the levels of urinary cotinine are
quite consistent with previous findings (see Table 1) The
somewhat higher current exposure to E TS found among
the population controls is not sumnsing since their mo-
bility is not limited by disease
Because a 3-tiered approach was used to determine
smoking status, information on study subjects' personal
use of tobacco was obtained first from the medical record
of lung cancer cases and colon cancer controls, then
from the study subject's personal physician, and later
from the next-of-kin respondent The information ob-
tained from the medical record and the physician was
almost always originally provided by the study subject
herself; therefore, in the case of a study subject unable
to personally respond or provide a urine sample, her
status as a never smoker was obtained from multiple
sources, and she was considered eligible only when there
was agreement among sources. This approach greatly
minimized the possibility of including smokers or ex-
smokers.

In response to Dr Marl1C1.5 concerns about misclas-
sification bias, interviews were conducted with next-of-
kin respondents to obtain information about 34% of the
lung cancer cases and 10% of the colon cancer controls
because the study subjects themselves were either de-
ceased or too ill to respond, a reflection of the survival
differential for these two types of cancer: a 72% 1-year
survival rate for women wah colon cancer as compared
to 41% for king cancer (2). The estimates of relative risk
did not differ in analyses restricted to self or proxy
respondents.
The association between active smoking and lung
cancer is well established for all the main histological
types of lung cancer. incl ud ing ad enocareinoma and large
cell, small cell, and squamous cell carcinomas, with dif-
ferences only in the magnitude of the risk (3). One of the
specific aims of this study was to evaluate the histological
specificity of the ITS-king cancer association by exam-
ining the relationship for each of the main histological
types We did not have our choice of which histological
type to emphasize because most cases turned out to be
adenocarcinomas after histological review. The number
of squamous cell, large cell, and small cell carcinomas
was insufficient to achieve reasonable statistical power
in histological tYpe-spetific analyses. The very high pro-
portion of adenocsionomas, consistent across all five
study centers, was an unanticipated and interesting find-
ing, even though it is known that adenocarcinoma is the
predominant cell type in nonsmokers and in all women
regardless of smoking history. The number of cases with
large cell, squamous cell, and small cell carcinomas will
increase with the 2 additional years of study, but if the
present trend continues, they will likely remain a rela-
tively small proportion of the total lung cancer cases.

ously published studies in a number of respects, it is
important to realize that it has a number of imitations
which affect interpretation.
One limitation is that it is an interim report, repre-
senting the findings of the first 3 years of a 5-year study,
so that, even for the subjects considered, some data (on
cotinine and on type of lung cancer) are incomplete.
More seriously, no use at all has been made, at this stage,
of data c011eCted on such other risk facings as occupation,
diet, medical history, and other exposures of interest, SO
that a potential confounding of ETS with some of these
factors has not been taken into account. Iwo recent
studies (1, 2) have demonstrated substantially reduced
dietary ft-carotene levels in nonsmokers in relation to
ETS exposure and have estimated that confounding of
the ETS/lung cancer relationship from this source alone
could bias the relative risk upward by to% or more, and
it seems plausible that adjustment for this and other
confounding variables might Slave substantially reduced,
and made statistically insignificant, the observed associ-
ations of lung cancer with various indices of US
exposure. •
Failure to take into account what might he termed
'relevant denominators' is another source of potential
confounding. Thus the analysis of spousal exposure is
not limited to married women, the analysis of occupa-
tional exposure is not limited to working women, the
analysis of social exposure is not adjusted for number of
social occasions, and so on. This leads to an inevitable
confusion of possible effects of (TS with possible effects
of marital status, occupation, and sociability (and their
correlates).
An explicit attempt has been made in this study to
minimize bias due to misclassification of active smoking
status. However, the procedures used seem in fact to be
of limited value. Using smoking data from the medical
record and from the physician, which would normally
have been ',muscled by the subject, is not of much use
in validating statements by the subject. Independent
statements by the next of kin or colleagues at woik would
have been more valuable. Urinary cot mine taken from
women with lung cancer is also less useful than it might
seem, since many would have given up smoking after
contracting the disease. In any case, urinary cotinine does
not reflect past smoking.
It is claimed that • the possibility of recall bias is
minimized by the use of colon cancer controls who,
compared with the cases, are 'similarly motivated to
recall earlier exposures. In view of the attention given
in the media to ETS as a possible cause of lung cancer,
but not cobs' cancer, this seems arguable, and the pos-
sibility ol recall bias is heightened by the large difference
in the proportion of next-of-kin respondents providing
data 134% for cases and 10% for colon cancer controls).
It is claimed that the association of ETS with lung
cancer was specific for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Is
this in fact true? Table 6 of the Fontham article gives a
relative risk for household exposure for adenocarcinoma
of L38 (95% confidence interval, '1.04-1.82) and for all
lung cancer of 1.21 (0,96-1 54), from which I estimate
(approximately) a relative risk of 0.95 10.65-1.35) for
noesaidenocarcinoma, which is not significantly different
statistically from that for adenocarcinoma, thus failing to
justify the special attention given to the adenocarcrnoma
results
It would indeed be remarkable if ETS were really to
increase the risk of adenocarcinoma by 50% as claimed,
given that the association of active smoking with adeno-
cardnorna is so weak, and given the much lower expo-
sure to smoke constituents from ETS than from active
smoking
Particular attention is given to the dose relationship
for lung cancer risk in relation to pack-years of exposure
from the spouse. and it is stated that 'a dose response,
not likely due to chance, was apparent for exposure to
tobacco smoke dunce adult life from a variety of expo-
sure sources' When one examines the data shown in
Table 6 of Fontham et dl. a different impression is given.
Within the exposed categories, a tendency for response
to rise smoothly with increasing exposure is only seen in
two of the eight dose-response relationships, and even
in these two the trend is dearly not significant. One gels
the impression that the reason the authors chose specif-
ically to present in graphical form results for spouse pads-
years of exposure was that this was the index (of many
tried) that best showed a smooth relationship It would
have been better had they not overemphasized one
specific relationship selected a posteriori.

Dr Lee raises several issues with regard to our report on
ETS and lung cancer. His first concern is that it is an
interim report, representing 3 years of a 5-year study.
We felt as the time, and remain convinced, that the
availability of a large data set with which to address an
unresohred issue oi great public health importance was
compelling justification for publishing a report. Data
based on colinine analysis and histopathological review
were not complete for all study subjects at the time ol

found to be ineligible as a result of the procedures
completed to date, few if any changes would be ex-
pected in the eligible case and control series, one addi-
tional case after pathology review, and one case. two
colon controls, and two population controls after com-
pletion of cotinine analysis might be excluded, a total of
six possible study subjects of i551.
Many, but certainly not all, potential confounders
were considered in the analyses, including age, race,
eeographie region, respondent type, income, and edu-
Gabon. Only age had a significant effect on the observed
reLitionships. Given the large number of study subjects
exposed to EIS and the relatively small number with
occupational, medical, or "other" risk factors, it is unlikely
that confounding by these factors would either substan-
tially reduce or elevate the observed associations. The
effects of these risk factors will be examined in further
analyses. We are doing an extensive analysis of dietary
factors, in particular fruits and vegetables, fats, and an-
tioxidant micronutrients incluchng 1J-carotene. Potential
conlotmding of the ETS lung cancer relationship by rel-
evant dietary factors will be evaluated. it does not appear
that dietary intake of-carotene is related to the spouse's
smoking habits in our study. Mean daily intake of e-
t-Nolen" does not significantly differ between study sub-
jects whose spouse smoked and those whose spouse
never smoked. This is true for the total pool of study
subjects and after stratification by case-control status.
This is, of course, only one indicator and does not elim-
inate the possibility of some confounding, but suggests
that effects, if any, are not likely to he major.
Dr. Lee suggests that the 'relevant" denominators
are not all female lifetime never smokers at risk of lung
cancer with and without exposure, but rather female
lifetime never smokers with exposure and a subset with-
out exposure (e.g., married, but spouse did not smoke)
after excluding another subset without exposure (e.g.,
never married, therefore not exposed to spouse who
smoked). The relevance of a denominator selected in
this fashion is debatable. That aside, restricting analysis
to ever-married women had a minimal effect on the total
sample size or on estimates of nsk. Ten of 420 cases
(2.4%) and 43 of 1131 controls (3.8%) had never been
married. The risk estimates excluding these study sub-
jects were 1.18 compared to 1.21 in the original analysis
lot al lung cancer and 1.12 compared to 1.38 for ade-
nocarcinoma associated with exposure to ETS from a
smoking spouse. In our series, 135 women had never
been emphoyed (50 cases and 85 controls) The estimates
of risk associated with occupational E TS exposure among
ever-employed women were 1.fi2 compared to 1.34 in
the original analysis for all lung cancer and 1.84 for
adenocarcinorria of the lung compared to 1.44.
Information on smoking status was obtained from
the medical record, physician, and study subject in a
tiered afftoach. The data obtained from each source
were issues, originally provided by the study subject, the
most knowledgeable source, in response to different
questions from different individuals during dirferent time
periods, with a consistent response of 'never smoked"
required. The chart response was not used to validate
the subject or next-of kin response but to eliminate "ever
smokers' from the pool for further inquiry. Dr. Lee ac-
curately points out that urinary cotinine is an indicator of
current, not past, smoking status, as clearly stated in our
report.
Whether recall bias is minimized, eliminated, or
exaggerated by the choice of a particular control group
is problematic in any epidemiological study. Dr. Lee's
point was again clearly stated in the text: 'The internal
consistency of the findings with the two control groups
suggests that recall bias resulting from a diagnosis of
cancer is not a likely explanation of the observed effect.
The possibility remains that nonsmoking women with
lung cancer and nonsmoking women with colon cancer
are not similarly motivated to remember exposures to
the tobacco smoke of others.' The larger proportion of
next-of-kin respondents providing data for lung cancer
cases (34%) than for colon cancer controls (10%) reflects
the realities of the two diseases: the 1-year survival rate
for white women with colon cancer is 72% compared to
41% for lung cancer (1). As reported, the estimates of
relative risk were similar regardless of respondent type.
A strong association of active smoking has been
reported for all types of pulmonary carcinomas including
squarnous cell, small cell, and adenocarcinoma, differing
only in the magnitude of the effect (2). The special
attention given to adenocarcinorna is warranted in view
of the fact that 78% of the reviewed cases in female
never smokers were adenocarcinoma, a remarkably high
proportion. The differences in composition of main-
stream and sidestream smoke have been well described
(3). That exposute sidestreatn smoke might result In a
distribution of histological types of lung cancer different
from that associated with exposure to mainstream smoke
is biologically plausible.
DOSC (cigarettes/day), duration (years), and an index
of dose and duration (pack-years) were selected a priori
as indicators of exposure from an individual (spouse,
mother, father, other household members). Duration is
more easily quantified in a setting where "dose" is pro-
vided from multiple individuals. That was the rationale
for the selection of duration as an indicator of ETS ex-
posure in such settings as shown in Table 6.

REVIEW OF
"LUNG CANCER IN NONSMOYING WOMEN:
A MULTICENTER CASE-CONTROL STUDY"

Buffler, Chan, Boyd, Alterman, Austin, Liff and D. Greenberg
Cancer Eoidemioloctv. Biomarkers and Prevention, 1, 35-45, 1991.

SUMMARY
• The Fontham study is the largest case-control study of
lifetime nonsmokers and lung cancer reported to date in the
scientific literature, involving 431 nonsmoking cases and
794 population controls.
• The authors state that the study was designed specifically
to address some of the methodological faults of previous
studies of ETS and lung cancer, including inadequate
attention to confounding factors and misclassification of
smoking status and inadequate confirmation of lung cancer
diagnosis.
• The authors claim that the study provides the strongest
available evidence that ETS increases the risk for lung
cancer in nonsmokers.
MAJOR FINDINGS
• The study reports a statistically significant relative risk
for adenocarcinoma of 1.47 based on spousal smoke exposure.
• The study reports a statistically significant dose-response
trend for adenocarcinoma based on spousal smoking, noting
increased risk with increased exposure.
• ETS exposure in the workplace and social settings also is
addressed. The authors report a statistically significant
40 to 60 percent increase in adenocarcinoma risk with ETS
exposure in both settings.
• No significant association is reported between exposure to
ETS in childhood and risk of lung cancer.
• No significant association is reported for all cell types
examined based on spousal smoking.
5664050Si

MAJOR CRITICISMS
• The current study reports data from only the first three
years of a five year study. The data also are incomplete in
a number of areas: urinary cotinine analyses to rule out
misclassification of smoking status are not complete, nor
are histopathologic diagnoses of lung cancer status.
• Data on potential confounding factors -- including
occupation, diet and family medical history -- have not been
incorporated into the analyses reported, even though the
authors acknowledge that the data were collected. Thus,
although the study may have been designed to correct for
this serious methodological problem, the problem still
exists in the current analyses.
• The authors report a statistically significant lung cancer
risk only for adenocarcinoma. This finding is inconsistent
with other studies of ETS and lung cancer, which generally
have not demonstrated significant increased risk for this
cancer form.
• The authors report consistent dose-response data only for
spousal smoking exposure. For workplace and social
exposures, dose-response trends are not consistent: risk
first increases with increased exposure, then declines in
the highest exposure category.
• Despite the authors' claims, misclassification of smoking
status has not adequately been taken into account. Among
other problems, approximately 30 percent of case interviews
were coducted with next of kin rather than with cases
themselves.
EFFECT OF THE STUDY ON META ANALYSIS.
• Inclusion of the Fontaham study has little effect on meta
analysis of all studies of ETS and lung cancer.
• Xeta analysis of U.S. studies, based on unadjusted data,
becomes statistically significant with inclusion of the new
study.
• Inclusion of the new study in meta analysis of workplace
exposure studies increases the relative risk from 0.98 to
1.02, but does not produce statistically significant
results.
566405082

• Chapter 6, Pages 6-16,17 and 8-6: Wells has stated that "... misclassification rates
derived from the community surveys are too high." His justification is based on
three basic arguments: (1) Correction of male epidemiologic data for
misclassification rates obtained from community based data results in "over-
correction;" (2) Misclassification rates based on discordant answers (rather than
cotinine chemistry) are significantly lower for lung cancer cases than for non-lung-
cancer cohorts in a number of epidemiologic studies (Tables B-4 and B-5); (3)
Fontham's cotinine-based misclassification rates are much lower than those
derived from community surveys.
All three arguments are problematic. The male-data argument is addressed in our
bullet-point to Page 8-6 Paragraph 2 shown above. Argument number 2 is based
primarily on non-American data (Tables 8-4 and 8-5), in violation of Wells'
operating principles. In addition, discordant answer data are likely to be subject
to greater uncertainty than objective cotinine measurements. Finally the "Fontham
argument" is fallacious for at least three reasons_ First, the procedure used for
identifying and eliminating possible smokers from the self-reported never-smokers
was far more rigorous than that used in any of the other ten American studies as
emphasized in Table 4. Consequently, few deceivers are expected to remain
undiscovered at the time of the final cotinine assay. Second, common sense
suggests that a subject diagnosed with lung cancer is highly motivated to quit
smoking. Finally, most U.S. hospitals are smoke-free. As a result, hospital-bound

patients who smoke are not only constrained by an especially acute smoking
stigma, but also have limited physical opportunities to smoke. The cotinine assay
is capable only of determining whether the subject has smoked within the
preceding three to five days. No inference can be made about lifetime, or even
recent (> 5-day) smoking history. Al! these factors serve to curtail the
"representativeness" of the Fontham misclassification rates, and even call into
question the validity of the Fontham misclassification adjustment itself.'

Abstract
The association between exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke and lung cancer in female lifetime
nonsmokers was evaluated using data collected during
Ike first 3 years elan ongoing case-control study. This
large, multicenter, population-based study was
designed to minimize some of the methodological
problems which have been of concern in previous
studies of environmental tobacco smoke and lung
cancer. Both a cancer control group and a population
control group were selected in order to evaluate recall
bias. A uniform histopathological review of diagnostic
material was conducted for case confirmation and
detailed classification. Biochemical determination of
current exposure to tobacco and screening of multiple
sources of information to determine lifetime nonuse
were utilized to minimize misclassification of smokers
as nonsmokers.
A 30% Increased risk of lung cancer was
associated with exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke from a spouse, and a 50% increase was
observed for adenocarcinoma of the lung. A
statistically significant positive trend in risk was
observed as pack-years of exposure from a spouse
Increased, reaching a relative risk of 1.7 for pulmonary
ad,enocarcinorna with exposures of NO or more pack-
years. The predominant cell type of the reviewed,
eligible lung cancer cases was adenocarcinoma (78%).
Results were very similar when cases were compared to
each control group and when separate analyses were

Other adult-life exposures in household, occupational,
and social settings were each associated with a 40-
60% increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung. No
association was found between risk of any type of lung
cancer and childhood exposures from a father, mother,
or other household members.
Introduction
Approximately one decade has passed since the initial
reports of increased risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking
women married to smokers (1. 2). The ensuing studies
have provided a body of data which suggests a small but
significant elevation in risk of lung cancer associated with
exposure to ITS' (3-22). In reported prospective studies
exposure has been assessed by the spouse's smoking
history, primarily that of husbands. In case-control stud-
ies, the primary ITS exposure assessed has also been

other household exposures, and the workplace have
been examined in some studies.
In general, these studies have included fewer than
100 nonsmoking lung cancer cases whose self-reported
smoking status has not been validated by biochemical
determination or other means. Reviews of available stud-
ies of ITS and lung cancer in nonsmokers by the National
Research Council 123), the International Agency for Can-
cer Research (24), and others (25. 261 have concluded
that although misclassification is unlikely to account for
all of the observed increased risk, some misclassification
of current or former smokers as nonsmokers is likely

of the magnitude of the observed effect.
This study was undertaken in 1985 in an effort to
address a number of unresolved issues related to ITS:

it is important to take into account potential confounding
factors and effect modifying 'actors in a study with a
sufficiently large number ol cases and controls. It is
anticipated that upon completion of this study about 600
cases and twice that number of controls will have
participated.
This report represents findings from the ongoing
study and includes the largest number of lifetime non-
smokers with lung cancels reported to date. This report
was felt to be justified given the public health importance
of the issue under investigation.
Methods
The study is a population-based case-control study of
lung cancer in women who have never used any tobacco
product. This preliminary report inctudes cases diag-
nosed during the first three years (December I, 1985
through December 31, 1988) of a 5-year study. At the
time of diagnosis cases were residents of one of five
major metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
including Atlanta (Clayton. Cobb. DeKalb, Fulton. and
Cwinnett counties), Houston (Galveston and Hams
counties), Los Angeles (Los Angeles County), New One-
ins (Jefferson, Orleans. and St. Bernard parishes), and
the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda. Contra Costa.
Mann, San Francisco. San Mateo, and Santa Clara town-
ties). representing a population of approximately 18.5
million people or 8% of the U. S. population.
Case and Control Selection
Rapid case ascertainment procedures. which included
review of pathology reports from study hospitals. were
utilized to identify potenhally eligible lung cancer cases.
Eligible cases included English-. Spanish-. or Chinese-
speaking females, aged 20-79. who had a histopatholog-
ically confirmed diagnosis of primary carcinoma of the
lung (International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision,
code 1621 made prior to death, had no history of previous
cancer, arid who were lifetime nonusers of tobacco.
Lifetime nonusers of tobacco are defined for this study
as persons who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes
and had not used any other form of tobacco (or more
than 6 months.
Two control groups were selected. The first control
group, referred to as the population control group, was
selected by random digit dialing and supplemented by
random sampling from the files of the Health Care Fi-
nancing Administration for women aged 65 arid older.
Controls were frequency matched to cases on age (<50,
50-59. 60-69. 70+ years) in a 2.1 control:case ratio They
met the same eligibility criteria as cases for age, resi-
dence. language, and tobacco use.
Females, aged 20-79, with a diagnosis of primary
carcinoma of the colon (International Classification of
Disease. 9th Revision. code 153) who met the Language,
previous cancer, lifetime nonsmoking, and residential
eligibility criteria of the cases, were identified and fre-
quency matched to lung cancer cases by 10-year age
groups and race. This second control group was selected
because there is no established increased risk of colon
cancer associated with either active or passive smoking,
and it provided an opportunity to examine the issue of
recall bias associated with a recent diagnosis of cancer.
A multistep procedure was used to determine life-
time smoking status. After identification of a potentially
eligible lung cancer case or colon cancer control, the
hospital chart was reviewed to obtain demographic data
and available information on tobacco use. Patients iden-
tified as current or former smokers in the medical record
were considered ineligible. In study areas where individ-
ual physician notification was required/preferred, the
tobacco use history was requested from the physician
for potentially eligible cases and colon controls identified
as nonusers of tobacco or with unknown smoking status
according to the hospital record. Women who were
identified as current or former smokers by their physi-
cians were considered ineligible All remaining cases and
colon cancer controls believed to be nonsmokers or with
unknown smoking status were contacted by telephone
to elicit information on tobacco use. Women who re-
ported ever smoking 100 or more cigarettes or using any
other form of tobacco for more than 6 months were
considered ineligible. The identical telephone screening
procedure was used for the population control group. At
the time of the interview. the tobacco use screening
questions were repeated to confirm each study subject's
reported nonuse of tobacco
The questionnaire was translated Nom English into
Spanish and Chinese. and interviewers fluent in those
languages conducted the non-English as well as English
interviews. Interviews were completed for 431 of 514
incident cases (84%), 358 of 489 colon cancer controls
(73%), and 794 of 1105 population controls (72%). Sixty-
one (3.8%) of the interviews were conducted in Spanish
in •k 14) or Chinese In 471 22 cases (5%): 23 colon
cancer controls (6%); and 16 population controls 41.5%1
A next-of-kin interview was solicited for lung cancer cases
and colon cancer controls who were too ill or deceased.
All population controls were self-respondents because
of the sampling method used to identify these controls
A total of 1.13 lung cancer case interviews and 35 of 352
colon cancer control interviews were conducted with
next-of-kin respondents, representing 34% and 10% of
the eligible respondents.
An extensive structured questionnaire obtained in-
formation concerning household, occupational, and
other exposures to environmental tobacco smoke during

Eligibility Review Procedures
Biochemical Determination of Current Tobacco Use. Co
a major metabolite of nicotine, is an indicator of
recent exposure to tobacco (27). Urinary cotinine was
used to corroborate seli-reported current nonsmoking
status of study subjects. A urine sample was collected
from all consenting study subjecis lithe time of inter-
view. The specimens were stored at —20"C until ship-
ment to the American Health Foundation for analysis
Cohnine was quantitated by radioimmunoassay us-
ing the method of Haley et al. (28) with 3 modification
of the antibody of Langone et al. 1291 Cotinine levels
were achusted for urine flow based on creatinine values
by determining the cotinineicreatinine ratio. Creatinine
was determined by spectrephotometry using the Kodak
Ektachem 400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
At this time biochemical analysis is complete for 239
of 431 cases (55.5%), 260 of 358 colon cancer controls
422.6%i, and 684 of 794 population controls 186.1%1
(Table 1). Two of 239 case samples (0.8%), 7 of 260 colon
cancer control samples (2.6%1, and 14 of 684 population
control samples (2.0%) had cohninekreatinine levels of
100 rig/mg or greater. There is no established cotininej
creatinine level which clearly discriminates smokers from
true nonsmokers heavily exposed to ETS. Under rela-
tively high levels of exposure to EIS in sutral and in
exposure chambers. urinary excretion has reached a level
of 55 rig/mg creaiinine 130, 311. In this study, women
whose coUnme/creatinine level exceeded 100 rig/mg
were excluded from the study to eliminate persons likely
to be active smokers, while allowing for the possibility of
very high CTS exposures reflected in unnary levels of 56-
99 rig/mg creatinine. Had the lower value of 55 rig/mg
been Selected as a cutpoint to avoid possible misclassi-
fication of active smokers as nonsmokers. 4 additional
cases (1.6%), 2 colon cancer controls (0.8%), and 13
population controls (1.9%) would have been excluded
from the analyses, with negligible effect on the results.
Histopatholosical Review. Representative diagnostic mi-
croscopic tissue slides for each case were requested from

ogist specializing in pulmonary pathology. A total of 368
of 429 1n%1 potential cases have undergone review. As
shown in Table 2. 359(98%) of the reviewed cases were
confirmed as primary bronchogenic carcinoma. The his-
topathological primary cell type of the eligible cases is as
follows. adenocarcinoma, 78%; large cell carcinoma.
12%; squamous cell carcinoma. 6%; small cell carcinoma.
3%. others, T% The hisiopathological cell type distribu-
tions were similar in the five study renters.
The overall concordance between the review pa-
thology diagnosis and the original hospital pathology
diagnosis was 81% frable 3). The concordance vaned
greatly by hisiopathologiral cell type Ninety-seven %
(237 of 2-14) of the cases originally classified as adeno-
carcinomas were confirmed as this histopathological type
upon review Similarly. 10 of 11 191•/.) ot small cell
carcinomas were so classified upon review. Concordance
rates of 56% and 67% were seen for large cell and
squamous cell carcinomas, respectively A relatively large
proportion of cases originally classified as large cell or
squamous cell carcinomas were classified as adenocar-
cinomas by the review pathologist: 18 of 46 (39%) and 6
of 24 (25%). respectively. Based on hospital paihology
reports. 34 subiects were categorized as 'other primary
lung carcinomas which primarily included diagnoses of
poorly differentiated carcinoma, bronchogenic carci-
noma not otherwise specified, or malignant cells not
otherwise specified. Upon review, 94% of these cases
were classified into more specific htstopathologtcal cell
types.
The nine cases (2%) found not to have primary
bronchogenic carcinoma on review were excluded Iron'
all analyses. Three of these nine cases were determined
to be caranoid tumors, two were lymphomas. three were
carcinomas metastatic to the lungs from other primary
sites, and one was a benign neoplasm. The 61 cases that
have not undergone histopathological review are in-
cluded in analyses of all lung cancers combined (n
420) but are not included in analyses stratified by histo-
pathological type.

parents after that time were classified as other household

years of cigarette exposure from the spouse were calcu-
lated by multiplying the number of packs smoked per
day by the number of years the spouse smoked cigarettes
while living with the study subject Pack-years of expo-
sure were summed for all smoking spouses of each study
subject.
One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate
the association of ETS with specific histopathological cell
types of lung cancer. The skewed distribution of hrsto-
pathological types precluded any meaningful analysis by
specific tell type other than adenocarcinoma and all
other cell types combined. The results are presented for
all lung cancers combined In w 420) and adenocarano-
mas confirmed by histopashological review in 281).
Cases were compared—el each control group with
regard to the distribution of relevant covariates such as
age. education, income, and race/eihnicity. The associ-
ation of ETS exposure with lung cancer risk was investi-
gated first in contingency tables stratified by design or
sampling variables (age, race, study centerl and relevant
covariates Summary adjusted odds ratios and test statis-
tics were calculated by the method of Mantel and Haen-
szel (321. Unconditional logistic regression analyses were
then used to estimate the associations by summary ad-
justed odds ratios, confidence limits, and test statistics
(33, 341.
Results
Demographic characteristics of cases and controls are
presented in Table 4. Cases and controls were similar
with respect to matching variables and most demo-
graphic variables. The largest number of cases (n w 160,
38%) were residents of Los Angeles, followed by cases
from the San Francisco Bay Area in = 149, 35%). and
then the three smaller study centers in the southern
United Stales; Atlanta (ri w 46, 11%); Houston (n w 39,
9%), and New Orleans in w 26, 6%).
The age distribution of cases and controls is uniform,
with 73 to 74% of each series between the ages of 60
through 79. The proporl ion of older women in this group
of female nonsmokers with lung cancer is higher than
that among all female lung cancer cases in the SEER
Program 1974-1986, in which only 48% of the cases
were aged 65 or older (35).
Cases tended to have a somewhat lower household
income and less education than the population controls.
Approximately 35% of cases and controls spent their
chitdhood in cities with populations of 50.000 or more,
and the maiority of cases and controls (70%. 68%, 77%
for cases, colon cancer controls, and population controls.
respectively) resided in cities during most of their adult
life.
The estimaied risks of lung cancer in nonsmoking
women associated with ever having lived with a spouse
who smoked are presented in able 5. The adjusted ORs
and the 95% CI are very similar for all spouse-related
exposures regardless of control group. For all histopath-
°logical types of lung cancer combined. a 30% increase
in risk is observed (OR w 1 28 and 1.29 with colon cancer
and population controls) For each of the three types of
tobacco smoked, the ORs ranged from 1.14 to 1.26
When the case series is restricted to the 281 pulmonary
adenocarcrnomas confirmed by histopathological review.
the association is more pronounced. Approximately 50%
elevations in risk of adenocarcinomas of the lung tP <
0.051are associated with any use cri tobacco by spousetsl, -
and cigarette smoking accounts for most of the tobacco
use. The estimated relative risk of pulmonary adenocar-
cinoma associated with cigarette smoking by spouses
was 1.36 (1.02-1.84) with the population controls as
comparison and 1.31 10 94-1.841 with the colon cancer
controls as comparison. No association between spouses'
tobacco use and lung cancers other than adenocaro-
noma (squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and other; n
= 78) was observed.
Separate analyses were conducted for sublects who
personally responded and for whom information was
obtained from surrogate respondents. The odds ratios for
involuntary exposure to ETS were very similar for both
groups of respondents, therefore, the results are not
presented in the tables separately by type of respondent.
One such example is the estimated relative risk of pul-
monary adenocarcinomas associated with cigarette
smoking by the spouse: OR = 1 38 and 1.30 for surrogate
and self-respondents, respectively. comparing cases to
colon cancer controls.
Effects by study center were also examined. The
odds ratios by cenier ranged from a low ol 1.17 101 high
of 2 64 for risk of pulmonary adenocarcrnoma associated
with spouses' cigarette smoking ,Because of the limited
sample sizes, none of the individual study center esti-

Estimates of relative risk associated with the number

cancer and population controls. respectively. Odds ratios
were similar, although slightly lower, for all types of lung
cancer combined: 1.70 (1.02-2 134) and 1.36(0.90-2.06).
Pack-years were examined as a combined measure
of duration and dose of exposure to the husband's ciga-
rette smoking. The odds ratios for all cell types of lung
cancer combined and for adenocarcinoma of the lung
are displayed in Fig. 1. Separate analyses were conducted
with each control group for comparison. Because the
findings were so similar for each group. the results are
presented for the two control series combined In
11311. An increasing risk of lung cancer and adenocarci-
noma of the lung associated with an increasing level of
exposure to the spouse's cigarette smoking was lound

Exposure to ETS from various sources during adult
life was evaluated. The results are summarized in Table
6. For simplicity cot presentation, the data in this tabie
also represent the findings using the two control groups
combined because the individual results using each con-
trol group were entirely consistent Exposures to cigarette
smoking from spouses), other household members. on
the job and in other activities ot adult life rsocian are
each associated with an overall 40-60% significant ele-
vation in the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung. As
noted previously for spouse-related exposures. ihe risk
estimates for all lung cancers without regard to cell type
tend to be slightly lower than the comparable estimates
for adenocarcinoma ot the lung. Significant positive
trends (P < 0.05) in risl, of adenocarcinoma of the lung
were associated with increasing duration (years' of ex-
posure to cigarette smoke from a spouse, other house-
hold members, and social occasions. For adult household
exposures from a spouse and others. estimates of risk
rose from lowest to hrghest in the 30 or more years of
exposure category; however, trends were not smooth for
exposures in occupational and social settings.
No association was found between risk of any type
of lung cancer and childhood exposure to cigars. pipes.
cigarettes, or all types of tobacco combined. Table 7
presents the estimated relative risks of lung cancer and
adenocarcinoma of the lung among nonsmoking women
whose father, mother, or other household member
smoked during childhood. None differed significantly
from unity. Years of exposure and amount smoked were
also examined. No significant elevations in risk were
found at any level of smoking by household members
during childhood.
Discussion
One of the most striking findings of this studs is the
distribution of the htstopathological cell types ot lung
cancer in a population-based series of cases well
screened to determine lifetime nonsmoker status. Sey-
enty•eightS of 359 reviewed eligible cases in this report
were classified as adenocarcinomas. This high proportion
of adenocarc inornas and the paucity of squarnous and
small cell carcinomas was consistent across all study

0001Cet other than occuoanonal and household members, including
veolar carcinoma, comprised 46.1% of the total female
nonsmoking cases. In the Swedish study of Pershagen et
af. 1351. 57% of 77 female nonsmokers were adenocar-
Cioomas and 31% squamous and small cell carcinomas.
The only statistically significant ETS-associated increased
risk was for squamous and small cell carcinomas. the cell
types with the highest relative risks associated with active
smoking. Al the present time small numbers of squamous
cell and small cell carcinomas in our data set preclude
an adequate assessment of risk associated with ITS ex-
posures for these cell types..
The findings of our study lend some support to the
mechanism proposed by Wynder and Goodman (36)
whereby inhalation of sidestream smoke might primarily
increase risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung. They tug-
Bested that inhalation of sidesheam smoke through the
nasal passages would hinder deposition of respirable
smoke particulates in the periphery of the lung while

formaldehyde. acetaldehyde. or nitrogen oxides, would
be likely to reach the deeper part of the lung Both
squamous cell and small cell carcinomas tend to be
centrally located, rather than in the periphery of the lung
Our study found statistically significant elevated risks
of adenocarcinoma of the lung among female non-
smokers who had had household ET5 exposure or EIS
exposure in occupational settings or from other sources.
Each of these exposures occurred during adulthood.
Exposures during the first 18 years of life were consist-
ently unrelated to the risk of lung cancer.
Any exposure (ever/never) from a spouse who
smoked was associated with at least a 30% excess risk.
Increasing amount per day and years smoked significantly
increased risk. The pattern of risk was the same when
cases were compared to colon cancer cases or popula-
tion controls and was specific for adenocarcinoma of the
lung. findings for all lung cancers combined reflect the
association between ITS and adenocam inoma of the lung
diluted by the weak association with other cell types.
The internal consistency of findings with the two
control groups suggests that recall bias resulting from
having a diagnosis of cancer is not a likely explanation of
the observed effect. The possibility remains that non-
smoking lung cancer cases and nonsmoking colon cancer
cases are not similarly motivated to remember exposures
to the tobacco smoke of others
The longest duration of exposure to EIS is associated
with the greatest elevation in risk, 1 43. for exposure of
30 or more years to a husbands's cigarette smoking.
Although significant trends were found tor other adult
exposures, the dose response was not monotonic rela-
tive risi, estimates tended to decline in the longest ex-
posure category. One possible explanation is that recall
of quantitative measures ol exposure is less reliable for
exposures outside the home and for household members
other than the spouse. A recent ten-country study was
carried out by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer designed to validate self-reported recent expo-
sure of nonsmoking women to (IS from any source
compared with the urinary concentration of cofinine.
Duration of daily exposure to E15 horn the husband was
the strongest predictor of urinary counine (37). Studies
by Peon et al. (38) and Coultas et at (39) suggest that
quantitative measures, particularly for exposures outside
the home, are less reliable than categorical measures.
The lack of any association between childhood EIS
exposures and lung cancer in our study, as well as the
strong, consistent association with exposures during
adulthood. contrasts with two recent repons by lanerich
et at 1221 and Wu-Williams ei al. (401. Differences in
study design may contribute to the discrepant findings.
About 25% (n = 45) of the 191 cases in the New York
study were males, whereas our study was restricted to
female cases (n 4201(22). The authors report that there
were only small differences between men and women in
the amount of exposure to EIS measured by duration.
The mean exposure of women to their husbands to-
bacco smoke was 16/ t 16.7 years. while men had a
mean exposure of 13.01. 17.0 years ham smoking wives.
Furthermore. there was a higher correlation between
exposure from spouses lifetime EIS exposure for women
in the study (r = 0.511 than for men tr 0.371. Intensity
(dose) of exposure and temporality of exposure from
male and female smoker sources may differ considerably.
Relatively small differences in dose, temporality, and

duration in combination may yield more meaningful dif-
ferences in exposure than that measured by duration
alone. The inclusion of males in the New York study,
with possibly lower doses of ITS exposure from smoking
wives for fewer years and during a more recent time
period. may have reduced the relative risk estimates that
were not gender specific. A study in northeast China,
which was comparable in size to our study. actually
found a decreased risk of lung cancer associated with
ETS exposures from spouses and a suggestive increased
risk associated with paternal smoking (401. As suggested
by the authors, these women had heavy exposures to
both indoor and outdoor pollutants, which may have
obscured any effect of ITS.
The studies which have examined childhood expo-
sures are more limited than those which have focused
on tobacco use by spouses, and the overall findings are
inconclusive (3. 5, 11-14, 22. 41). Siud.es of the reliability
of recall of E15 exposures suggest that recall of a parent's
smoking history is less reliable than that for spouses (38.
391, and this may account RS part for inconsistencies
between studies, lanench et at. (221 found a 2-told in-
creased risk associated with 25 or more smoker-years
during childhood and adolescence but no increase for
childhood exposures of less than 25 smoker-years (OR
1,091. In most studies which have reported positive
associations, the findings have been primarily for mater-
nal ETS exposures in smokers rather than in nonsmokers.
Correa et al. (5) found a significantly increased risk of
lung cancer IOR 1.361 among smokers whose mother
smoked but no increased risk in nonsmokers and no
elevated risk associated with the father's smoking. Wu er
al. (14) mooned a nonsignificantly elevated risk of ade-
nocarcinoma of the lung (OR 1.7) in females. 80% of
whom had a history of smoking. Similarly, in a Swedish
study of female lung cancer which included primarily
smokers, a nonsignificanthe elevated risk was associated
with maternal (OR mg 1.81 but not paternal (OR in 0.8)
smoking 1421. Other studies have failed to find an in-
creased risk Of lung cancer associated with childhood
exposures (11,-12, 43). None of these studies examined
maternal smoking as distinct from other childhood ex-
posures Childhood ITS exposures alone may be insuf-
ficient to increase lung cancer risk in lifetime nonsmokers
but may increase risk in persons exposed transolacentally
or during childhood who later smoke themselves (5).
The female lifetime nonsmokers with lung cancer in
our study are considerably older than the female lung
cancer cases reported in the SEER program, most of
whom have actively smoked. This may represent a cohort
effect: that is, older women are less likely to have
smoked. The age disparity might also reflect possible
differences in response among active and passive smok-
ers. The lower dose of ITS might require a longer dura-
tion of exposure for pulmonary carcinogenesis.
Alihough this report represents the findings of the
first 3 years or a 5-year study, ft is nevertheless the largest
case-control study reported in date on this topic. The
findings provide additional evidence in favor of a causal
relationship between exposure to EIS and lung cancer
in women who have never used tobacco themselves. A
dose response, not likely due to chance, was apparent
for exposure to tobacco smoke during adult life from a
variety of exposure sources The association was specific
for both adenocarcinoma ot the lung and for all lung
cancers combined compared to colon cancer

b. EPA included certain reported data from an
incomplete study (Fontham, 2991). Only the first three
years of the five years scheduled have been completed
and publication occurred before additional planned
steps of verification had been undertaken. Although
EPA included certain data from this incomplete study,
it failed to include data relating to confounding
factors which bad been 'collected by the study's
authors.
0. EPA violated its own criteria for determining
what data to select with respeot to one study
(Janerich). Specifically, EPA used unadjusted risk
estimates from household exposure from Janerich while
it used adjusted risk estimates from spousal exposure
from all other studies from which adjusted risk -
estimates could be derived.
57. Fourth, EPA failed to adjust adequately for smoking
status misclassification bias, which in known to inflate the
apparent association observed in studies of spousal smoking and
lung cancer. Although EPA acknowledged this one source of bias
and purported to adjust for it, EPA used a method of adjustment
based on unrepresentative data instead of more representative
data. EPA's use of these unrepresentative data resulted in an
extremely low and unrealistic rate of adjustment that is not
representative of the U.S. population for this crucial variable.

Summary Queenons about the smoking habets of
parents and spouses were asked in a cut-
control study invoiving 1338 lung cancer patients and 1393
comparison sub's-en in Lostisiana, USA. Non-smokers
married to heavy smokers had an increased risk of lung
cancer, and so did sublects whose mothers smoked. There
was no association between lung cancer risk Ind paternal
s.moking. The association with maternal smoking was found
only in smokers and persisted after controlling for variables
indicative of active smoking. It is not clear whether she results
reflect a biological effect associated with Mater all smoking or
the inabihty to control adevrely for calionn ding factors
related to active smoking This pr eluninsry finding deserves
further mvestigation.
Introduction
THE possibility...of possree or involuntary smoking being a
causative factor in lung cancer has been investigated in
several countries." This repots describes s case-control
study of lung cancer in Louisiana in which questions were
asked about the smoking habits of the spouses and parents of
1338 lung cancer patients and 1393 comparison subjects
(controls).

Results
Spouse Smoking
We identified non-smokers with lung cancer and compared
the saraiiing histories of their spouses with those of s pouses of
non-smoking controls Only 10 out of 1036 male cases were
non-smokers- 2 reported occupations/ exposure ED dust
(atreet-eweeper, log-curter); I was $ steam-pipe fitter; 2 lived
in the immediate vicinity of industrial plants (train elevator
and cement, oil refinery), I was married to p heavy smoker,
and 4 were long-time chewers of tobacco. There were 25 non-
smoking, ever-married women with lung cancer out of 302
female cases; 2 of these chewed tobacco stralarly. For I
female and 2 malt Don-smoking patients no information was
available on the smoking history of the spouse. 2 female
patients' husbands were smokers but the amount and
duration was unknown.
Tablet distributes the non-smoking, ever-married men and
women according to total lifetime pack-years smoked by then
spouses at the time of the interview. The relative risk of lung
cancer as raised when the spouse is a heavy smoker.
Similar tabulations for smoking sublects did not show an
increased risk associated with smoking of spouses, except for
light smoking men (less than 20 pack-years), who had a
relative risk of 1-5 when married to heavy smokers (41 pack-
years or more). Cue-control comparisons based on current
daily number of demotes smoked by the spouse yielded
almost identical findings, including relative risk estimates,
with those presented in table I. The apparent passive
exposure effect was present in women over and under 60
years of age, although small numbers made the subgroup
findings not statisticilly significant. Analyses limited to uses
and controls interviewed in person indicated that systematic
bias in personal versus next-of-kin responses can be ruled out
as a potential explar.stion for the findings The same
conclusion was embed when relative risks were race
adiusted. inclusion of bronehioalveolar carcinomas resulted
in slightly lower odds ratios. males 1-69, females 1-77, both
sexes 1-75.
Parents' Smoking Habits
Smoking habits ofthe parents strongly influenced smoking
habits in offspring (table n). Heavy smokers were more likely
than the other patients to hive had smoking parents. The
smoking histories of the parents in OW series were associated
with each other. There were 201 spouse pairs of smokers,
compared with 136 expected if the status of each parent was

independently distributed. Classification of the status of one
inumber, particularly the mother, indirectly conveys
information on the status of the marital partner.
Whas the smoking stints of such parent is classified
separately the relative risks outing cancer for persons (both
sexes, smokers and non-smokers) with 3 positive paternal and
maternal history of-smoking are 1•04 and 1-66, respectively
(table 111). Scrutiny of the data shows that the increased risk
=Loci= ed with maternal smoking is significant in smoking
males (odds ratio 1-4) but norsignificant in smoking females
(adds ratio I -2} No significant itiCFLideS in risk were found in
non-smokers but small numbers preclude adequate analysis
(there was only one non-smoking lung cancer patient whose
mother was a smoker). To remove the confounding effect of
the ether parent, we considered each subset of eases and
controls for which only one of the parents smoked. The
respective relative risks, controlled for spouse-smoking
status, for positive paternal and maternal his-torus ofsrooking
were 0.45 and 147, respectively. Thus, smoking Status of
the mother increases the relative risk of lung cancer, iiut
smoking tutus of the father does not. The effect of matanal
smoking did not seem to be dose related, our questionnaire
did not cover this point extensively because we doubted
whether children could adequately quantitate then parents'
smoking history. The relative risk of lung cancer when both
parents smoked was I 46; there is thus no evidence of trl
additions' contribution to risk from paternal exposure, over
sod above that contributed by maternal exposure.
Given the enhancing effect of parentsl smoking on the
smoking habits of the offspring, the effect of parental
smoking on relative risk of lung cancer could reflect a subtle
indirect association with active smoking by the subject. To
control for active smoking, a logistic regression analysis was
done, taking into account all the active smoking variablcs
which increase lung cancer risk: age at which case started
making, tar content of usual brand, degree of inhalation, use
of hand-rolled cigarettes, ran of smoking, maximum
amount smoked. y this method of/n*1*s the relative risk
associated with maternal smoking was: 1.36 (p<0•02) for
both sexes and 1 • 5 (p<0-01) for males. No increase in risk

in male smokers whose mothers smoked.
Discussion
Spouse-making Effect
Our dats strengtbeo the contention that heavy smoking by
one member of the spouse pair increases the lung cancer risk
of the nonsmoking partner. Heavy smoking by wives may
increase the risk of the light smoking husband but this finding
requires funha analysis and confirmation in larger series.
Smoking by husbands did not affect the risk prim); cancer in
women who smoked (relative risk 1.03), * finding that
suggests that active smoking is so powerful that it
overshadows any possible additions] effect from curio:mg ant
passive exposure.
The proportion of lung carcinomas that were
adenocarcinomas in non-smoking women was 54%,
compared with 22% for smoking women. The association of
sdenoetrcinoma with smoking is weaker than for other
histological types. The risk of squarnous arid small cell
carcinomas among smokers, relstive to a unit risk for non-
smokers, has been reported to be 15-4, compared with 5-1
for aclenourcinoma l Tablet may therefore reflect dilution of
the relation by nxission of adenocircinornas. Exclusion of
adenocarcinomas produced a significant linear tread in risk,
as found by Tnehopolous et *1.2 The posaibiluy that
differences in the chemical composition of mainstream
(a a ive)and s idest ream (neuzve)smoke may produce different
proportions of histological types of rumours should be
considered. The nitroumine content in =dr:stream smoke is
reported to be approximately 50 times greater than that in
entusuresm smoke
The effect of the smoking habits of the spouse on lung
cancer risk was first reported by Huayarns in a Japanese
cohort study A cohort study in the United Stases reported a
positive but not significant Merritt in risk for non-smoking
women married to smoking husbands.' A case-control study
of non-smoking women diagnosed as having lung cancer in
Greece reported relative risks of approxicnstely 2-5 for those
married to moderate smokers and 3 for those married to heavy
smokers, with a significant linear trend 2 Our numbers are
small but we think that the similarity between our rustlings
and those of Trichopolous et el2 strengthens the suspicion
that passive smoking may contribute to lung cancer risk.
Parearal SmakOti Effect
As fat is we know, ours is the first case-control study of lung
cancer reporting on parental smoking history. Pirents'
=mann& behaviour influences the smoking habits of their
offspeing,4•2 but we found that the smoking behsviour of the
father does not influence the lung cancer risk ofhis offspring,
whereas the behaviour of the mother dom. This difference
may reflect the closer and more prolonged contact that infants
and young children have with their mothers than with their
fathers.
The risk of bronchitis and pneumonia is increased in
children whose mothers traoke." This Oleo is dose related
and is greater in the winter, strongly suggesting that passive
smoking by the =lint is causally related to risk of respiratory
infection. The excess of bronchitis otenns after 6 months of
age, suggesting that the passive immunity transferred from
mother to child prevents bacterial colonisation of bronchial
mucosa. The effect of passive srnoeing on brooctuns may be
independent of the mutagenic effect of the tobacco srtsokei°
and is is probably safe to assume that the child is exposed to

both the irritant and the motagenic ins-ults carried by

Broodiatis in infects may have bog-tatting effect on
the respiratory tract as suggested by the increase in the
prevalence of cough at age 20 in subjects who have had
respiratory illness during the first 2 years of life, independent
of current smoking habits.'
Whether bronchitis is Call12131T factor in lung cancer is
coriounded by the fact thar smoking induces both mar snd
bronelints. Cohort undies have concluded that "persons who
smoke cigarettes run a higher risk of chronic bronchitis than
n n-smokers and those who develop brorichitis run a higher
risk of developing lung cancer"."
How maternal smoking causes lung cancer can at this rage
only be a matter of speculation- By itself, passive smoking
daring childhood may not be sufficient stimulus for
carcinogenesis. However, laboratory work has shown that!
transplacental exposiue to carcinogens increases the
carcinogenic response to posonatal =power to the same or so
• different carcinogen,' 5 benze{alpyrene, a mutagernc
carcniogen found in tobacco smoke, when infected into
prepare mice, induces cancer of thc lung and other organs of
the offspeing;" tumours develop in 3396 of the offspring of
pregnant hatristerLtreolcd with high doses of cigarette smoke
eondenaatroi' and small doses of carcinogens can induce
tumours in fetal tissue.3
The effects of maternal smoking are only significant in
males, especially the heavy smokers. Perhaps maternal
smoking enhances active smoking by the offspring in subtle
ways not detected by conventional techniques If our
methods for controlling for active smoking are not
sufficiently refined, the increase in risk associated with
maternal smoking would not be an effect of passive smoking
but tine of enhancement of active smoking behavioural
potterns. This is a real possibility and we would like to
encourage further research on the subject.
Cendryien
The differences benseen the effects of passive exposure to
spouse and maternal smoking are puzzling. FaSSIVC exposure
to spouse smoking is meetly detected in non-smokers and
light smoking males; maternal passive smoking effects are
Keil mostly in smokers, Passive smoking from spouses is
introduced in adult life and in smokers is concurrent with
their own active smoking The magnitude of such an effect
may be low when compared with active concomitant smoking
and n may not be detectable when both types of smoking are
present
Maternal smoking, on the other hand, exerts its influences
early in life and in the absence of active smoking is probably
inseffieient to product carcinogenic effects. Our aotTLIS
inc that maternal smoking results in a slight incrcloe in
lung cancer risk but do not indicate whether the effect is due
to enhanced active smoking of the Offspring or to enhanced
susceptibility to lung cancer induction after the challenge of
sonic smoking liner in life.
Our findings point to the nerd for more research on the
subrect of passive smoking and cancer. Since large numbers
ofeases noy be needed for adequate epidemiological analysis,
nun ionstitunonal collaboration may be indicated.

A group of 28 patients with extreme, life'
threatening senanitiviry to guaranis:mit=

The femalefmale rid° was 8/1. Sensitivity may be present
without previous exposure to suximetboaium; in 3 patients
motions occurred during the first exposure to anaesthesia.

Introduction
DRUGS of the muscle-relaxant group Ire commonly
implicated an systemic reactions, some woes kfe-threstening,
which occur during general anaesthesia. Saxe 1977 patients
at our hospital who have had SCyCje anaesthetic reactions
have been skin-tested to determine drug sensitivity. After two
deaths sttributed to smamethonium inAucklarid in 1982, a
study of known sensitive patients was undenaken, initially to
determine whether 'Ethycholine', the only summetbomum
chloride available in New Zealand, differed in provoking

are of adequate quality. Indeed. there is the
question whether any of these studies meets
even minimal standards of quality 150. 51).
Letzcl et of, 151] considered the effects of
misclassification errors on the results of the
NRC's meta-analysis. They assumed three sets
of conservative rates of misclassification for
both disease and exposure to ETS. and, after
adjusting for misclassification, concluded that
"taking all this evidence together our calcu-
lations show that the findings of all studies
about female lung cancer from passive smoking
are consistent with the null hypothesis." 'Their
final statement, also worth quoting, reads: "This
brings us to final conclusion that there arc
presently only 2 alternatives—accepting the null
hypothesis or creating new empirical evidence
by peforming a really good study."
We shall nevertheless meta-analyze the nine
American epidemiological studies that have, to
our knowledge. been performed, the five that
were included in the NRC report 1481 plus four
more recent ones. It is important to remind
ourselves beforehand that there arc many biases
and confounders that will tend to inflate the
relative risk. An especially important onc is the
misclassification of actual smokers as non-
smokers. As Lee (52, 53) and Lead es al. (511
point out, a woman who claims TO be a non-
smoker is more likely to be or to have been an
actual smoker if married to a smoker than if
married to a non-smoker. Other sources of bias
include the misclassification of disease (i.e. rnis-
classifying a non-lung cancer patient as having
lung cancer as the primary disease, and misclas-
sifying a lung cancer patient as not having
cancer (5I]), differing lifestyles between house-
holds where tobacco is used and those where
tobacco is not used, and differential exposure
and duration of exposure to air pollution be-
tween the exposed and unexposed groups. These
biases have been considered to varying degrees
by researchers in the field, with generally little
success in controlling them.
One major source of bias that has not been
analyzed sufficiently thoroughly, and has not yet
been adequately controlled, is the misclassifi-
cation of the spouse's smoking history (in this
discussion the spouse is the husband or wife of
the patient or of the control). It is possible that
a non-smoking woman with lung cancer will
overestimate the amount or duration of her
husband's smoking in an attempt to find a
causal explanation for her disease. The same
tendency might be expected to exist when it is a
surrogate for the patient—a child or sibling, or
the spouse himself—who is being asked to re-
port on the spouse's smoking history. The latter
point is important because the proportion of
patients reported on by a surrogate exceeds
50% in some studies.
U.S. ssudies of ETS and lung cancer
There are many reasons for restricting atten-
tion to American studies of whether there is an
elevated risk of lung cancer to non-smokers
exposed to ETS relative to non-smokers not so
exposed. One is that this is the population to
whom policy decisions will apply and on whom
those decisions should be based. Another is that
the summary ORs in the individual studies arc
derived from distributions of smokine amounts
and durations. and of brands of cigarettes and
other tobacco products, that pertain TO popu-
lations within the U.S.. and may thus be
expected to be relatively homogeneous. Odds
ratios from studies in other countries, on the
other hand, are derived from distributions that
may differ markedly from those in the U.S.. and
thus the ORs themselves may not be relevant TO
the American experience. Genetic and lifestyle
differences between the U.S. population and the
populations studied elsewhere (mainly in cast
Asia) also argue for a meta-analysis only of U.S.
studies.
The first U.S. study, by  Garfinkel_ 513,_was a
prospective follow-up study of more than
175,000 women who reported themselves to he
non-smokers. All types of cancer of the lung
were taken as end points. A "non-smoker" in
this study was not only a women who reported
that she never smoked, but also one who re-
ported that she smoked only occasionally but
not regularly. Little if any attempt seems to have
been made to verify these women's self-reports.
The remaining U.S. studies were all ease-
control studies comparing patients with lung
cancer against one or another kind of compan-
son group. The first was the study in New
Orleans by Correa es controls were
patients with other diseases, from the same
hospitals as the lung cancer cases, who were
matched to the cases on age. sex and race.
Specially trained interviewers were relied on to
obtain exposure data for the eases arid controls.
although it is not clear whether the interviewers
were blinded to whether a patient was a case or
a control. The next of kin served as a proxy for
the patient in 24% of the cases and II'''. of the
controls.

the relative risk was not carried out, but in fact the difference in age dis-
tribution between the never smoking cases and controls was not great, so
this should be of little consequence. Similarly, there was no marked differ-
ence between cases and controls in cooking habits — the only potential
confounding factor studied in detail in this study.
2.4.6 Louisiana Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer — Correa
Correa et al. [64] describe results relating to ETS from their case-control
study in Louisiana of 1,338 lung cancer patients and 1,393 controls. Bron-
chic-alveolar carcinoma cascs were excluded from the main analysis. Con-
trols were patients matched on race, sex and age not suffering from 'various
smoking-associated diseases. Only 10 of 1,036 male cases and 25 of 302
female cases had never smoked.
The results (summarized in Table 2.21) relating to spouse cigarette
smoking for ever married, never smoking lung cancer PISCS and controls
showed an elevated risk in both sexes that was not statistically significant.
Inclusion of bronchio-alveolar carcinoma slightly reduced the estimated
relative risk (males; 1.69; females, 1.77).
The study clearly involves too few lung cancer cases to obtain any sort
of reliable estimate of risk. Correa et al. also broke down the relative risk
by pack-years of exposure, but this is dubious since it is an indicator as
much of age as of number of cigarettes per day — and the analyses con-
ducted do not adjust for age. There is also doubt about the selection of the
control group, with the inclusion of patients with diseases associated with
smoking, such as cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular
diseases. There is also a lack of comparability between cases and controls,
in that for 24% of the cases, but only 11% of the controls, information was
obtained from next of kin.
The results from this study are included in the combined analysis
presented by Dalager et al. 160].

2.4.7 Shanghai Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer — Gao
Gao et al. [65] identified 765 female lung cancer cases aged 35-69 in urban
Shanghai in 1984-86, 43% of which were diagnosed by tissue biopsy, 38%
by cytology and 19% by X-ray. Interviews were conducted with the 672
who were still alive, and also with 735 population-based controls selected
to have a similar age distribution to the cases. Some farther details are
given in a later paper by Gao et at 1661, where it is noted that 435 of the
cases and 605 of the controls had never smoked cigarettes on a regular
basis for as long as 6 months ('non-smokers').
The results relating to ETS reported in the earlier paper arc not clearly
presented. The authors note first that no significant increase in risk was
observed for overall exposure to ETS during childhood (relative risk, 1.1;
95% confidence limits, 0.7—L7) or in adult life (relative risk, 0.9, 95%
confidence limits, 0.6-1.4)', but do not make it clear whether these results
relate to all women or only to never smoking women. They then present a
table (Table 2.22) which indicates that 'lung cancer risks among non-smok-
ing women tended to increase with the number of years a woman lived
with a husband who smoked', but do not make it clear whether or not the
first category in this table includes women married to non-smoking hus-
bands. Consideration of the number of cases and controls compared with
the total suggests such women have been excluded, but how many such
women there were is not known, nor is any answer offered to the question
whether ETS exposure was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer
among women who have never smoked. It is also unclear to what extent the
trend apparent in the table may have resulted from incomplete adjustment
for age, bearing in mind the strong correlation of age both with risk of lung
cancer and with years smoked by the husband.

:-iong Kong, 1960'.
Material and Method
In 3 tt7:: survey oi bronchial cancer CMAN et al., 1979j, among 208 male patients only
:were non-smokers and among 189 female patients 84 were non-smokers. These form the
sdif)ects of this investigation. Matched controls were selected from orthopaedic pariiEts.
.31.11 ;vier= and controls were interviewed and questions asked abour smoking habit of
The:: spouses and their cooking habits. including the types of fuel used. Histological diag•
noses of the tumours were obtained.
Results
The age distributions of the non-smoker patients and of the marched controls arc shown
:n 7.26:e I. The highest incidence is in the group above -0.
The 'histoiogical types of the non-smoker's cancers are shown in T able 2. It can be seen
:1-4: act-mm=01m is the prevalent type. The two male Casts are too feiA• to be significant.
in a previous szuity CISAN and MicLENNAN. 07 this histological type was also high
among males although not as 'nigh as among females where it was 34..1% among 27-: cases.
itt Tabit .5. it is seen that there are less passive smokers among patients than the conrrols ;
inc more non-smoking patients have non-smoking spouses. This finding is at variance with
rnat oi Dr. iimiiyANLA'S '19131. He found that mortality from lung cancer of non-smoking
women exposed to clearerre smoke of their husbands was increased two folds. The haw-
logical types of their cancers were not given. The presenr group is of course very small in
comparison to Dr. 1-ink_nywmw's material.
The 'cooking habits of non-smoking women are shown in Table 4.

Mt aetiology of the adenocarcinoma among non-smokers 'nas been the subject of specula-
tion. In :he present survey no conclusion can be made on the par played by the cooking
halan. The association of carcinoma with tuberculosis was postulated by STEixrrz (1972).
Moo: e: al. '193) recently studied the association of active tuberculosis and lung cancer.
Tnrry =chicle::: that there was no causal relationship as both were quite common diseases
and chance association was quite probable.
The nigh Inc:dence of female cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma. among Southern
Curiese awaits further elucidation.
These may be a common factor in this region for the high incidence of adenocarcinoma
bceh mer. and women. As it is not connected v..11+1 cooking and smoking, the dietary habit
has to be f rther studied. In an experimental study. FONG and Cjii.N 1977' produced adeno-

population-based and decedent comparison subjects selected from state and

Among subjects 'rho had never smoked, the risk of lung cancer was non-
significantly reduced in those circumstances where a household member
smoked regularly compared with those where no household member
smoked regularly (Table 2.20) No relationship was seen when risk was
related to duration of exposure to a household member who smoked. No
analyses were presented in relation to ETS exposure hroken down by histo-
logical type or by type either or control or of respondent
One problem with this study relates to the fact that no attempt seems
to have been made to exclude from the study decedents with smoking-
associated diseases Also, a very high proportion of information was
obtained from next of kin, with the subject providing data only for 14% of
males and 21% of femalms. Dalager et al. [60] include results from this
study in their paper presenting analyses from combined data from three
studies funded by the National Cancer institute.
2.4.5 First Hong Kong Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer — Chan
Lam and Cheng [611 briefly describe four case-control studies of lung can-
cer carried out in Hong Kong. The first, which they refer to as thc 1976-77
study, has been reported in more detail by Chan et al. [62] and by Chan
and Fung [631. A total of 208 male and 189 female patients with lung
cancer and 204 male and 189 female orthopaedic controls in the same
general age group were interviewed in hospital. Effects of ETS it males
were not studied as there were only two lung cancer cases in those who had
never smoked. Among never smoking women (84 cases and 139 controls),
there was a non-significant negative relationship to lung cancer (estimated

relative risk, 0.75; 95% confidence limits, 0.43-1.30). Age adjustment of
the relative risk was not carried out, but in fact the difference in age dis-
tribution between the never smoking cases and controls was not great, so
this should be of little consequence. Similarly, there was no marked differ-
ence between cases and controls in cooking habits - the only potential
confounding factor studied in detail in this study.
2.4.6 Louisiana Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer - Correa
Correa et at. [64] describe results relating to ETS from their case-control
study in Louisiana of 1,338 lung cancer patients and 1,393 controls. Bron-
chio-alveolar carcinoma cases were excluded from the main analysis. Con-
trols were patients matched on race, sex and age not suffering from various
smoking-associated diseases. Only 10 of 1,036 male cases and 25 of 302
female cases had never smoked.
The results (summarized in Table 2.21) relating to spouse cigarette
smoking for ever married, never smoking lung cancer cases and controls
showed an elevated risk in both sexes that was not statistically significant.
Inclusion of bronchio-alveolar carcinoma slightly reduced the estimated
relative risk (males, 1.69; females, 1.77).
The study clearly involves too few lung cancer cases to obtain any sort
of reliable estimate of risk. Correa et al. also broke down the relative risk
by pack-years of exposure, but this is dubious since it is an indicator as
much of age as of number of cigarettes per day - and the analyses con-
ducted do not adjust for age. There is also doubt about thc selection of the
control group, with the inclusion of patients with diseases associated with
smoking, such as cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular
diseases. There is also a lack of comparability between cases and controls,
in that for 24% of the cases, but only 11% of the controls, information was
obtained from next of kin.
The results from this study are included in the combined analysis
presented by Dalager et al. [60].

ABSTRACT OF THE OCSERTATION
The Relationship of Passive Smoking to Various
Health Outcomes among Seventh-day Adventists in California
by
Terrence Leslie Butler
Doctor of Public Health
University of California. Los Angeles. 1986
Professor Barbara Visscher. Chair
The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship or
passive  arnolung to the incidence of canters. fatal ischerrec heart disease
and all natural cause mortality among Californian Seventh-day
Adventists. From the 34.445 subjects of the Adventist Health Study
cohort 11976-19E121. twO sub-groups were selected to evaluate the
research questions. One. ate spouse issurS cohort. consisted of 11.060
married couples. The second was a grow of 6.467 subiects, referred to
as me Al-ISMOG cohort who were involved in a concurrent air pollution
study. Follow-up for ascertainment of cancer loiclence and mortality
was horn 1976 to 1982. Passrve srnokng exposure for me 'spouse parrs
566405140

was based an the tv.istiard's smoking status n marriape. For the
AHSMOG cohort EreAronmental Tobac.co Smoke exposure was based on
ate number of years 5ved with and the number of years worked with a
smoker. The Alantef-Haereszel approach and an exact method ler sparse
data were used to calo.date acr5usted sarnrrary rate ratios (RR) and
approixiate 45% C.I. For non-smoldni females of the spouse pairs
cohort age-adjusted rate ratios and (95% CA.) tcr each outcome
represent those females married to a smoker compared to those females
married to a non-smoker. Lung cancer RR-2.01 (0.39-8.79). an smoking
related canters RR* 1_22 (0.61-244); cervical cancer RR =4.86 (1.33-17.66)
and all Incident cancers RR 1.20 (0.94-1.54). For females married to
current smokers there was increased risk for fatal 11-(0. RR = 1.40 (0,51-
3.84). No effect was observed for al natural c.ausa traprtalay. For the
Al-I SMOG cohort the results were less ccinsisterrt by type of exposure
measure and outcome. For tamales there was some sugi9Dston of an
effect for king cancer, al cancers, all cause mortality and IND
mortality. For males there was an rsdicabon of an effect for lung
cancer. smokrig retated cancers, all cancers and ischerric hea.n disease.
The small number of cases tor some outcomes and the probable
misclassilicatan of passive smokkuz exposure limited the abdrry to
achieve conctusive results. However, the results indicate an adverse
effect tor ETS exposure and are consistent with other reported results.

CHAPTER 1: 14TRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
For more than twenty years tl has been recognized that active cigarene
smoking is associated with a number of acute and chronic diseases and
thy one or mote constituents of tobacco smoke play an integral role in
the development of aartain tumors and cardiovascular crtsease (US DHFIS
198:2). Since 1964, the US Surgeon General has presented 18 repons
documenting causal relationships between tobacco smoke and king cancer,
other cancers, crvonic king disease and cardiovascular disease (US Dill-IS
1964-1986). Since the inception of the tobacco smoking habit many non-
smokers have been conscious of the irritatkag and annoying effects of
tobacco smoke_
In 1904 King James 1 of England it his tounterblaste to
Tobacco' called smoking:
'A custom loathsome to the eye. hatetul to the nose,
harmful to the twain, arid dangerous to the lurig.'
Whereas this royal condemnation was directed at ateve
smoking, Samuel Johnsen, a century later, wrote al passrve
smoking: lt is a shocking thing, blowing smoke out of our
mouths into other people's mouths, cry-ea and noses, and
having the SaITUI thing done to us (NH and MRC 1987).
However, it is only in recent years that study has been given to the
specific role of environrnernal tobacco smoke in the development al
respiratory disease, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Al this poim in
lime the health effects of passive smoking have become a maior motic

heaith issue, not only in the US& but throughout much of ale woncL
Numerous ordriances have been passed by local and ciotrrty governments
regulating the smoking or tobacco in public places in order to protect
the health or non-smokers and preserve their right to breathe urpolkned

non-smoking children ol smakeig parents compared to those who are not
exposed to cigarette smoke (US Dirt-tS 1984). There is aiso increasing
evidence that passive smoking its assoclaled with an increased risk of
lung cancer and some other smoking related cancers (US IN-41-iS 1986,
National Research Council 1986). Some studies suggest that
environmental tobar-co smoke aggravates the condition or angina patients
(Amino* 1978). ln eckiition. orher studies have reported an increased
nsk of cardiovascular disease among non-srnokers who are exposed to
passive smoking (Garland 198.5. Sends en 1987). The results of studies
concerning other cancers and cardavascular disease have been
inconsistent. There is some controversy over the magnitude of risk for
lung cancer and whether the apparent etect. for other chronic diseases

12 RESEAACH HYPOTHESES
It is tie purpose of this study to investvate and test the hypothesis
that passive smoking is related to an irborease n chronic cti_sease
mortally and morbidity in a population otnerwase at tow-nsk tar these
diseases. The research will consider two measures of passive smoking
exposure and their relatioristap to a number of outcomes_ The research
questions are:
12_1
Do women rnamed to husbands wflQ smoke when compared
with women rnamed to non-smoking husbands have an
increased risk of:
a) all natural cause mortality,
b) ischemic heart disease mortality,
o) inddence ot king cancer, and
d) I nodence of other smoking related canc-ers;
12.2 Does long term exposure to passive smoking in the home and
work erwsronmeras lead to an increased risk oi:
a) a natural cause mortally,
b) ischerruc heal disease mortality,
C) incidence of lung cancer, and
co incidence of other smoking related cancers.

1.4 DERNITiONS AND CZASSIRCATION OF TERMS
For the purperses or this thesis, it is rookr-i.csary to clarify some ot the
terms that are used.
1.4.1. Passive Smoking.
Passive smoking is cfned as the int-uslation of erryircermental tobacco
smoke (ETS) by a non-smoker who is exposed to a smoking erivircirtmera.
This is opposed to active smoking in whuch smoker ectivety smokes a
tobacco proCruct arlizi inhales the aerosoL Ii is Imo that an active
smoker also passiviab, vitiates the ambient tobacco smoke in riiis
environment however, the arriptiasla ii this thesis is on the involurrlary
pa.ssrve smokeng done by non-smokers.
In mast saw-it:11c ittenattere passive smoking is used intefChangeatly with
the Wins 'irrroluntary smoking and 'inhalation of seccrld hand smoke'.
These terms wil aiso be used in this thous. EmironmenUil tobacco
smoke is the air paution that results from the txrninc of tobacco
products (cigarettes, cigars. p.rpe tobacco). The major pereion of ETS
contributed by sidestrearn smoke (SS), *trot' is produced by the
5
56G4051,46

smoldering tobacco product between putt drawng, Other contritxrtors to
ETS are the exhaled portion at mama-I:ream smoke (1.1S), the stricAce that
escapes From the tobacco durrig puff drawing, and other volatile
compounds that &fuse through cigarette paper.

cancer and a contrbutory factor ri her smokno related cancers,
cydiovascutar diseases and other chronic diseases (USDHI-LS 1982„ 1983,
1984), From a publoc health viewpoint dare11e smokrig is the scrigie
nwst important preventable factor that elects earty and overall
mco-taity. There Et a ctiThkellg Concern that non-smokers are at greater
nsk of disease and early dealt) horn the iihalalaon of environmental
tobacco smoke. Repace and Lowrey (14851 estimate that the lycrcal US
non-smokers is exposed to 1.4 mg of tar each day and that this exposure
accounts tor 5,0016 lung cancer deaths in non-smokers each year in the
Urvled States. These estimates are based On a compartson with
Seventh-day Adventmts (SDAs) who have a low risk rt rig cancer and
ale presumed not to be exposed to passive smoking because of the
church's proscription against smokrig. However. Mil may not be true
since SDAs are exposed to ETS in work environments and some SDAs
have Sztl ok spous-es while Crttititrs have been exposed rt the home mcx
to becorntng Seventh-day Advennsts. If nese situations occur then the
overall effect ol passive smokrag on chronic caseases may be greatar
man •-tirnated.

Moreover, passrve smoiang is amenable to control en work sites and en

Thereto-re, il a positive. uncontounded sisSoctatice can be shown between
passive smolung and smolung related canCers and ischemic heart disease
rn non-smokers these results covicf strengthen pubic health efforts to
reduce smoiung and rts subsequent economic and health affects.
As is noted in the lorowicg iterates rienew, some concern and
controversy still surrounds the magrutude arkl extent of the passive
smoking risk to noresmokers. The purpose of this Stiety ts to clarity
these issues. The particular value ot this study is that it endeavors to
quanttfy the effect of passe smoking et a group that is norrnaly at
knor nsk tor diseases associated with active smoking.
Seventh-day
Adventists are a uneeue gicx.ep in that the rnalority are non-smokers and
Otherwise harnogenerxts in a number ol iiiestyle and demographic

22 COMPARLSON OF MAINSTREAM AND SIDESTRF_AM SMO+CE
Tobacco smoke is a compLex mature of over 3.800 chemical compoundS.
Many of Mese substances both in vapor and particulate form have been
shown to be irritants, toxins, ruutagens. and Garai-N:9.0ns (US OH-IS 1981.
1486). Almost 6.0 of these compounds are known or suspected
cancicriogens and occur mainity in Me partio.date phasc of tobacco smoke
(NH & MRC 1987). The crincertralion arid com)osrtion of ETS depends
to a great deal on a mantle( of factors induct's-3g the rx.imber of
cigarettes smoked. the aging of tobacco smoke, the rate of verniation ii
the enciosed space, the types al surfaces on which the Oart3cu1ates

becaus-e cia the closer proximity to the burning tobacco products the

Nevertheless, it is apparent that non-smckers who spend time in smoky
environments are exposed to small doses of these irdabng and toxic
substances.

such twigs as the size of the enclosed space, the arncurd of Ictoacco
smoked. the number of peopieI, the room. the degree of ventilation.
the tale of air exchange. and the breathing pattern of the passive
smoker (Naticxial Research Council 1986). Methods Wed to quantity
pas.sive smoking exposure are a) air sampling techniques, itsuarly of
respirable suspended petiolate (RSP) Ieys, b) personal moruicirimg
instruments, and c) morotorng of beologioal rnarkers. Measurements
are often expressed in two ways. either in terrns of cigarette equirvalence
pet hour (CE/h), the amount at tobacco smoke Waled by a non-smoker
reiative to bat inhaled by an acbve smoker or, ii cigarette equivalent
time (CET), the amount of bme that a mon-smoker is required to spend
in a smoking environment to inhale the equivakent of we iagatette
mainstream smoke (Hugoirt 1978).
Russell, et al (1988) estimate thiat Co the average, paiL-4-nte smokers
absorb 0.7% the intake of actiyia smokers_ Hugocl (1978) showed that
there were ea:waffle dilemmas in CET vakies from different tobacco
smoke components ranging from 2.0 lor CO to 50.0 far nicotine. He
°striates that the averape passne smoker real never inhale mare than
the equivalent of .05 to I cigarette par day. Repaoe and Lowrey i1984)
estimate that the range of exposure to tobacco s.rnoke tor a passive
smoker is 0 to Itt mg at tobacco aerosol per day, with an aveKage of 1.4
16
566405/57

mcyday,wd is the equivalent al approoiTtatey 3 low tar cigarettes.
These vartations in estimates are posy due to th-e ent
experimental conotrnons under which these indirect measures were
obtained.
Personal mcnctoring by portable at' samplers ere a useful end direct
method for assessrig eiposire to ETS. However, tne instruments are
not feastile for Large population research studies. Optimal assessment of
the intake of US consOtuards is best done with the analysis of
prrysidogiaal fluids of exposed persons National Research Council 1985).
Currently Me best biological marker for tobacco 5 mak* exposure is

plasma, urine or sakva, and is a specific and SeftSitiVik riclicatix lor
tobacoo exposure. Matsukura, et al (1984) examined the relationship
between tainary coenne excrebon in 472 non-smokers and the smolithesS
of the envsninrnerst. 1-Lit discovered a dose response relationship
between the dgarettes smoked in the home and the cotirtine levels n
passive smokers. Those who lived with smokers et more than 40
cigarettes per day had cotinine Ieel5frofurraft to ectrve Stn0 1r-ern%
arn bkir U to 3 cigarettes per day. Those non-smckers also exposed al
work had higher counihe levels trian those who were only eitxisedUI

17
56S405158

a dose response relabonship with urrvary cotinine levels and he
repotted hours of expose to other peopke's smoke. Th-ese and other
data (Raley 1984, Jarvis 196-4, Husgalyel-Pursiainen 1987) provide some
validity of the cruannry of passive smoking exposure reported by non-
smOkers. However, Sepkoinc (1986) suggasts thal these cot:nine levels
non-schokers be interpreted cautiousty since non-smokers may have a
lower tolerance for nicotine than active smokers. He reported that the
rate of colinine disappearance Was twit* as longn pass2ve Mloicers
compared to chronic smokers, and therefore. suggest& that true cigarette
cep-violence is actually lower than that colailated. Repace and Lowrey
(1985), on the other hand, point oat that the reduced tolerance in non-
smokers may lead to a greater risk per unit dose of tobacco smoke
exposure. While cotirine assays may be the best method for oresentty
quantifying exposure to ETS. rt may not accurately reflect the uptake of
other vapors or paracuJates vi ETS, not does it measure cumutaave
d Ose s or 04-51 exposure s_
Most epaliirriolapCal stlicUts of passive smoking have used questionnaire
responses either from sell or proxy reports frcrn next of kin to estimate
the paswe smoking exposit:a of non-smokers.. The vabcWty of this
passzve smoking expostre assessment has been questioned (National
Research Council 1986, Fneciman 1983). Most studes have based EIS

of exposure may be quee accurate, the rile-tarty of exposure is difficult
to assess. Nevertheless. spousal expnsire may predict intensrty of
expo:awes outside of the home. Wald and Rilctee (1984) Sndwect that
non-smokers mamecl to SMOkitfl reported higher exposures outside of the
home compered to noresrnokers married to non-smokers. 4 is postulated
that persons exposed at home are more tolerant of ETS and are MOM

Vil-ide 40-63% of American homes have reported al least one active
smoker in the housenoki (US Di-E-IS 19:86, Schillng 1977), other reports
inctoate that there is busty to be more exposure at wort than in the
home (Wald 1984, Matsukura 1984). Most eduts in America spend at
least 85 to 45% of their time in two moor° enwonments, the home and
the work place (US DHHS 1488). Mule estimates of passrve smoking

2A GENERAL HEALTH EFFECTS
ExperSuse to ETS produces a number. of general health ettects, some
acute and others chronic .-A thorough treatment i theoutcomes are
beyond the scope of this thesis. However. a bne4 mention of these
effects is warranted in that the evide-nce supports The bodocic-at
olausibil,ry to heafin effects of low doses got passive smoking exposure.
20
5GC40510.

Acute heatth effects mentioned by exposed non-smokers are annoyance
with odor, eye wrdation and throat rritalion (US DHHS 1986). A
number of studies nave Shown that maternal smoiung during pregnancy is
associated with a lower birth weight and an increased risk of perinatal
mortality (National Research Council 19436). Although all s-turltes are not
consistent there is evidence that exposure to passive smok3ng in
chirtiood leads to incraased axis-fence of lower and upper resPgatorli
tract inlections (US ID,1414S 1988. NH & MRC 1987). Intants exposed to
their mother's smoke dunng the hrs1 year of life have apprrornately
twice the rate of lower respiratory tract infections compared to those
who are not exposed. There is some suggesbon also that children
sutienng with pre-existing disease such as asthma are adversely affected
by ETS. In two studies it haus been shown that EIS is an independent
risk factor for Sudden infant desrth synctrcrne (SIDS) (NH & MRC 1986).
Small decreases an Lung hrlottart have also been observed in souks and
children who axe expcised to pas.szve smoke. It has been suggested that
this may increase suscepbbigty to further lung disease tater in 6le (US
OHKS 1966).

2.5 PLAUSIMUTY OF A HEALTH EFFECT
There are a number of factors that support the Pausibiley 01 a Causal
association between eaposure to ETS and king cancer. some OthOf
cancers and ischemic heart cisaase, Actrie cigarette smoking ,rs a major
cause of early morbickty and mortality and a maior cause of king cancer
and a cortnbutory cause of Ge14.1 cancers. In addition, cigarette
smoking is a maior risk factor and cause of ischemic heart ase.
While ETS is guarrteatrrely and crualitatiy differeint from the
mainstream smoke absorbed by the active cigarette smoker. the
sicte.strearn snick* that is diluted in ambicall at ko form ETS actually has
higher concentrations or scrne toxic arid carcinogenic agents. The
uptake & tobacco smoke consteuents by passive smokers corresponds to
a low dc-se exposure in active cigarette smoker& in studies of active
smong there fs no threshold level of exposure bedew which there is no
actrerse effect for the smoker. Effects of a dose response relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung cancer haat been consistently
demonstrated. Cumulatme exposure or specific time perood exposure may

Even though there ts vanabrity of exposure and passive smokers recerve
tow doses of ETS rt is entirely plausibki that the risk ol lung cancer in
passive smokers approximates that of a light cigarette smoker. In the
case of other srnokng related cancers. the evidence is less conclusrve.
The corresponding etlects for these diseases would be small since the
retative risks as with active cigarette smoking are much srnalier
than those For lung cancer. However. once again it is ley that EIS is
a causal !actor in these diseases. A causal association can be
hypothesized for ischemso heal sease in non-smokers exposed to ETS
as nicobne and carbon monoxide, the major constituents of tobacco
smoke thought to be .m•-ncialed with IHD, are also absorbed by passive
smokers.
2.6 LUNG CANCER MIXES
ThOs section summarizes the epidemiological evidence on passive smoking
and lurig cancer. Fourteen case control stucies and three foliow-up
studies have been reported during 1981-1987. Tables 2.2 arid 2.3
summarize these studies. Comrxehonsive and critical review of twelve al
these case-control stuclieS arid the three cohort studies have recently
been published (US 01-1HS 1986. National Research Council 1986. Liberia
1987). In adon. other discussions and minor reviews of these studies
are atso available (13Iot 1988. Burch 1985, 1-liggins 1985. Mantel 1986, NH
23
56G/10316d

& MRC 1987, Pershagen 1986. Weiss 1986). Therefore. no attempt will
be made to discuss each individual study, except for the case-control
studies by Humble et al (1987) and Brownson et al (1987) which have
been reported since the rnalor reviews have been
26.1 Case Control 9xicrees
In the first reported study investigating the regatonship of passive
smoking and lung cancer. Trichopoulos el a1 (1981. 1983) presented case-
control data for 1112 female cases and 251 controht of whom 77 cases and
225 controls were rim-smokers. He reported odds ratios of 1.00. 1,90,
and 25 tor ncri-smoking women married to non-smokers, ex-smokers and
current smokers respectively. Cases were limited to non-
adenocarcincena. Although the odds relics were stalislicany signfficant
at the .06 level the study has been cried on the lolloving grounds:
inclusion of non--pathologically confirmed cases, selection bias because
controls were from a different hospital than the cases, the possibdity ol
interviewer bias since the interviewing physician knew status of both
cases and controls and the fact that passive smoking exposure was based
on spouse smoking status ally (Mantel 1981. Ubeda 1987),
Subsequently. the resutis of thrteen other case-control studios were
published (Correa et al. 1983: Chan and Fung, 1992; Koo et al, 1983:

While these studies present cordictrig and eQuivocal evuience 01 ar
association of passive srrioke with lung cancer which mew be expliuned by
chance, bias or confounding, the results cannot be regarded as negatrve
evidence since most studes ewe imited by the smal number of cases
aya.eable. When the results of the incbvidual studies are comtaned the
overall ri.k of lung cancer among non-smokers iving with smokers
compared to non-smokers living with non-smokers is. FIR 1.27 (9.5% CI
1.05-1.5) (Wald ei at. 1986.) This 27% increase in risk was highly
significant Some of thos irbcreasecl risk may be the resiutt of
mexiassitying some of the active smokers, who fived with srnoicers. as
non-smokers. Men Wald made adjustment ter this error. there was stiil
an increased nsk and he suggests that about 25% of king cancer cases in
non-smokers can be all-nbuted to pas_sive smoking exposure.
nother lirrirtaixon of most stufies was that assessmeril of ETS exposure
was based Cri explosure in the borne °ray. Most saidies used iicug with
a srno j spouse smoking betuivicr as the incicator of exposure, Koo,
Wu, Lee and Garfinkel included passive smoking exposure in the work

non-smokers were exposed. Since all sources of passive smoking were

In the cohort study corickicted by Gilis et al (1984) 8.128 residents of
two urfaan areas of Scc4laral were sunfeyed between 1972-1976 and
follow-up for outcomes of mortakty and incident cases of cancer. In
the sot years of follow-up, eight male rion-smokws and 43 female non-
smokers died of cancers other than lung cancer. For passive smoking
exposure there was no rut Cation of an increased nsk for males but for
tamales a small elevated risk. PR .124. The smag number of cases does
not allow defilade concksions to be drawn.
Reynolds et al (1987) analyzed data be-naming to the Alameda County
cohort of 6.928 adutts WhO wen, First survey-ed ri 1985. The cohort
contained 2.480 married c4up4es who completed the initial Quesctionnarre.

the results for females only because no as-social:kin was found between
passive smoking and caroer me-n. The irivestigators used spouse
smoking status as the risk inclacator for passive smoking and actrnmea
the r•rital3orts of this. Smokrng reLatecl cancers included cancer of lung,
mouth. esobnaguS. blackier. pancreas, her, kidney and utenna cervix_
Onty four cases of si-ooking riela/ed cancer occurred among non-smolong
females. The relative risk estimate of smoking rotated carer among
non-smoking females was 7.0 (90% C.1.1.05-47.0) and for al cancers the
RR was 1.68 (90% C.1. 1.1-2.5). Alhougei based on small numbers
cases and trrnrted to passrve smoke exposure from spouses these results
are consistent with the hypothesis that ETS exposure rncreases the risk
of cancer in non-smoidng females.
Sandler (1985) conducted a case control study of al cancer sites except

The assoctation oI crgarette smoking and ischernic heart thsease has been
wel recognczed (US DHHS 1963). Several studies stiggest That although
the risks may be smal, the expostre o non-snookers o passive smoke
may increase the risks tit eschernic heart disease (Table 2.5).
Hrayarna (198.3) reported in his follow-up study of 81.45C female non-
smokers in Japan that there was an increased risk tor those married to
husbands who smoked compared to those whose husbands did not smoke_
He also indicated a Siig-reficant dose response retittortship. Gillis (1984)
reported fatal (HO outcomes tor 21 lerna}es and 32 males.. Fa trie non-
srnakinc females the relative risk for exposure was 3.56. lHowever. thrs
was based on only two unexposed deaths and 19 deaths in the exposed,

CHAPTER 3: METHODS
3.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY
Severrth-ctay ACNentista lSDAs)„ also referred to as Adventists, are a
relattvery homogenous, health oriented. teligloull grouP who iend to be
conservative in their ifestyie habsts and behavior. Adventists, who b-ase
the delels and practices on a Judeo-Chran heritage. were otficiaty
organized as a crturch 1. OrigalaIly a North Arnencan based
church, today more than 85% al its adherents ive outside North
Arrierica. Members of JIy join the ctiurch by baptism or profession al
lartn usually during their early teenage to ad(t years. Approximately
half the members are adue converts to the church.
During the formative years of the church, leaders began to advocate
Wes-tyle habits and practices that would promote deter health. Tobacco
smolOrig and alcohol drintung became c-hurch proscnprions. The d-rurch
also encouraed Es members to aotheve to a no-flesh diet and to avoid
beverages contang caffeine. rich and highly refined tniNds and hot
condiments and spices_
Current data incbcate that the maionty of Califorruari Seventh-day
AcIvenirsts ac2-iere to the church proSc-rViDorls of smoking and akot104
(95% non-smokers, 85.% non-dnnikers). Approximately 50-% of the
43
5664051134

members practice a lacto-ovq-vegistanan diet_ Twenty tree percent of
the members are lifetime vegetarians whie another 25% adopted a
vegetarian diet soon eller joining the Church, usually adulthood. The
remaining 50% practice a non-vegetartan diet (Phillips RL_ Snowdon DA
186).
Because of their unique characteristics Sevenerclay Adventism provide
an ideal research group on *filch so test hypotheses which relate
lifestyle and del to heafth effects. Arthoirgh homogeneous in many
clernograplw chiaractennos they have a wide variation in diet and have
a low exposure to toOacco smoke and alcohol. Se fiC}U1 research alto the
health status of Adventists began in the tate 1950s when epiderrecdogests
focused Meer attention on the health effects of tobacco smoking.
Adventists provided an ;deal opportrity to investigate the risks of
smoking related dtseas-es n a
POPulalson that is predommately non-
smoking. ln 1960 tnvestigators at Loma Linda collaborated wilh the
American Cancer Society and its study of smoking and lung cancer.
Baseline demograptec, dietary, ifestyke and medical data were collected
from 25.000 Cakfornean Seventh-day Adventists aged 35 years and over.
This cohort was initially followed for a penal of six years to cleteermcne
causes of death. Subsequent follow-up was extended through 1980 and
dunng the total 21 years of follow-up 7.250 persons died, it was

32.1 Census Ouesdannaire
The overall development and prniression of the Adventist Heatth Sturty
IS illuStrated n Figure 11. In 1973, the low adrninistratroo conterencvs
of the Severrth-day Adveilist church in Callornia were requested to
su:pply a list of churches within the jurisdiction Subsequendy, the
church clerics in eadi of the 437 churches within California were asked
to provide church directories of au lamilies who were registered as
church members. There was a 100% response rate by the church clerks
and this resulted in a ros.ter of 63,530 Seventh-clay Adventist households.
In August of 1974, a self-administered questionnaire was mailed to the
head of each household. This questionnaire is referred to as the Census
Questionnaire (see Tatie 32 and Appendix 2).. The head of the
household answered basic demographic questions an hirriseif as well as
for each member of the family. This enumeration included non-

number of factors may ac-count tor the lower than expected respccs-a

househoids never received a questionnaire: b) Many 04 the church

some members had moved away from the focal church area; c) There
were numerous households which should new tare been included in the

biases will be evaluated in section 38. Linrtations and Bra.ses.
14.1 Data Quaky
The census arid klestyks questionnaires were criginally designed to be
entered and processed by an optical scanning method_ However, because
of ;problems with the alignment of the optical SCafl marks, the data was
eventually entered martualy into the computer by a data entry clerk, A
second clerk then re-entered arid verified the data The Census
Oi.pxstoraire was completed by the head of each i)ousehold, and
58
5%64(4199

therefore wa.s a proxy response tor other members at the !amity. To
check the reliability ol these responses a lace to face rriterveivr was
conducted by field representatives witt i random sample of 16-4
households six rruxehs OW the census questionnaire had been
competed L The head of the household who campieted the questionnaire
was rrIervieread first folowed by a tandornty selected other member of
the houserk:ed aver the age at 25. Except for education.al level and age
af baptism. th• discrepancy between head of household written and
interview responses was less than 6% for each of the other items_ As
expected the agreement between head of household responses was better
than for those where the head of the household had completed the
written Questionnaire for the dew larrdy members. For nine of the
fifteen ciscrepancies on education the respondent in the face to lace
interview indicated an educational level tot was high.ar than mal
recorded on the census quest:on-41re. Most el the discrepancies of the
age of baptism were wrthin a range of two years and were possibly due
to the drfficutty af accurately roosting an ervent that occurred many
years in the past ft is not likeiy that any of thesc inconsrstencles
would substanually or systematloaky bias the outcome results.
To e-nsure confidentiality of the exposure data collected an the lifestyle
questionnaire and to avoid trwafid responses an sensreve questions that

attachixt to the AI-E,SMOG questionnaire, assurances et conhdentality
were given wrth the covering Witter.
There Was some ooncem about the quaky at exposure date, particularly
those that related to matters an whkoh there were church proscriphons
or recommendabons_ Sod, questions were those on smoking, alcohole.

3.52 Cancer and ht.chernic Heart Disease Ascertainment
In January of every year from 1977 until 19873. except to the year 1980.
Hospital Hisaory Forms (HHF) (see Appendix 6 for sample forms) were
mated to every member of the iricadence population. These loans
requested the supect tio list whether he or she had experienced an-y

a6 PASSIVE SMOKING DPOSURE ASSESSMENT
Two ditlerent measurements of passive smoking exposure will be used in
the analyses. one for the AMS.140G cohort and the other lot the Spouse

°Hy provide a crude estimate of the actual dosage of passrve smoke
exposure a subiect receives. However, it is the bast exposure measure
that Is avaitatle. I is possiale that some subjects who report many
years of iving or yearlong with a smoker may actually have rrinenal

The method tor dmierrniung passive smoking exposure is baseO on the
25.SurripbOn that the age of baptism is. the !atoll age at WhaCh a baptized
SDA acluft stopped smoking. Smoiung ts a cnurch prosatption and one
of the behavior affirmations a member makes Or= to baptism is that
he she wil avoid the use of iti tobacco produ-cts. A ckohotornous
variable. smokrng status in marriage, is thus deterrrkned by comparing
the surrogate measure tor stopped smlang (age a tabosrn) to the ago
of mai-nage_

2_ Past smoker when age of bapbsrn is greater than the age of

3. Past smokers wtiO are not SDA baptized
A tiirther refinement m preaston cart be made by classifying past
smokers wrth less MaTi five years of smoking as non-smokers in
rnarnage. This reitriemera is based on the tact that in the general
copulation 65-88ti al males (depending on birth cohort) initiated
smoking before the age of twenty and the medan age of mamage for
the At-IS cohort was 24. For tamales in the general population 42-8.3!:

IR 3 Lliscias3inc.ation of Passive Smoking Exposure
We acknowledge that oi.rr passive smoking data is very frrgied and
subrecl to potential biases and problems. We chose a surrogate measure
tor Ihe spouse pairs cohort since Voli were unable to Orrectly assess
passrve smoking exposixe.
6-B
56C405209

MisciassiticatIon of paSsrve smoking exposure couid have occurred in
several ways._ We used the age of baptism as the Last date that an
Adventist would have regularly smoked cigarettes. Using this
information and the date of rharnage and the number of years regularly
smoked wo wdr able to create the isassive smoking variable. 'husband
smoking status in rharnage. tor the spouse pars cohol.
To determine whether this crude estimate of exposure was reasonable.
we used another method that required population data to estirnate
hu-sbahd smoking status in marriage. INS variable was not used in the
analyses. Mforrnation based on U.S. acputaticin surveys (Otto, on
Smoking arid Health 1957) ordcate that the mean age of smoking
commencement fox males is 15 years. This rnean age was used 34 an
estimate in the spouse pairs cohort tor the age meies started to smoke.
Since we know the number oi years regularly smoked and the age of
marriage it was possible by adding Me years regularly smoked to The
estimate of age commenced smoking and subtracting the age of marriage
to estimate the number of realS a subpect smoked during marriage.
From this intormaaon we created a clithcaornous vanatte of smoking
Status ri marnage. Tatole 92 provides a camparrson al the-se two
methods arid suggests that the original passive smoking vanab4e may be
Quite reasonable. ahho-ugh these undoutrtedly is some misclassification.

3-.2 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL LAETHC)DS
The chosen study design es a cohort analysis of two sub-grouos wrthin
the Adventist Hear, Study (1974.1982). Thts design uses the exposure
data collected at bassikre ci incividuals wilo were tree of the disease
outcomes ol iriterest al the commencement of the study and prirog to the
panod of follow-up lo( CO 54 of cisease. time periods of 1050w-up
Ln person months were Calculaied for each subtect in the study. For
each outcome at interest pers-on lane was calculated from the month the
Lifestyle questionnaire was carnOietecl to ono of several anclporus. This
was either the date of di:twos:is of dzsease for cases and kw npn-r-aSeS
the month tne subpect w-as cens-ored from the studry. Indri.eduals were
censored at Me date of death or at the end at the study (December 31.
1982) or at the point in time they withdrew from the Study and were
lost to follow-up. The ascertainment ci cases and the curni.glation of
person time lot each ce_itcome enables the calctiallion of incidence rates
Or each cle.,ease in bach the exposed arid non-exposed groups_ This in
turn allows for the &red calcutahon of knader14:33 rate ratios or relative
rIsfts (RR). This measure of effect is approonate for these data
(GreerVand. 1987).

approach is preferable when the data are sparse. The mid prcbatikty

computer program dweedoped by Guess.
For mcinalrty outcomes. for which there are a reasonable number of

3.9 UUTTATIONS AND POTENTIAL PROBLBAS OF STUDY
19-1 Inadequacy ot Expostse Data
1. We only know smoking Status at 01 !NI completion of Me Lifestyle
Questionnaire in 1976. We do not have Information on the year
subject started or stopped Smckaig.
2_ We do not have a :treasure of number of the cigarettes regularly
smoked in The horn Vis possible that smokrig spouses married
lo Seventh-day Arlrenests may arnoke leis in the home in
Adventists n general have been well aware at the adverse &leas
01 srricilung for n-any years.
3. We do nal have a caataraed marital testory - oniy the age ol &rat
marriage. Thereioni, it wauki be iMPOSSable 10 calculate married
years of passive smoke expo:sass tor any second or Mid
marriages_ However, Advenbsts and this cohort 1.1 particular have
a low divcrc:e rate and therefore any second marriages are most
Fey because of death of the original partner. tt this occurs
Later in lite art Adventst wil mast ikety rn-ruxy another non-
Arh.enust_
As staled earlier, a crude measure at years at exposure could be
catculated by using the date ol entry into the SDA churcti as the latest
date that the subject regularly smoked This would most tIeJy bras the
79
5'66405240

results towarcts the mail j g would overestimate years ot exposure.
Additxmal smoking data (year started. you stopoed smotung} and
detailed passrve smokrog clam
are currently being coriecreo on vie
AHSMOG cohort. However. Mese data will not be available lor those
who are deceased. At the same time. it couid serve as'a rehabikry
check of the exposure measures.
3.92 laisclassrficalicn of Smoking Stzais on 197IS Lifestyle Otkesskonnare
Since smoking is a church prosonpecn rt is possible thal some smokers
may have actually denied Mity were smokers. however, it ES more iikely
they never responded tO the questionnaire in +which case they cannot be
Included in the analyses. If there was a non-differentia]
rrisciar.-.sification the result would be biased toward the null.
3.9.3 Limited Specific Disease Outcomes
It is recognized that since this is a low risk population there will be
small number ol cases for specific cancer sties. Separate analyses will
be performed tor lung cancer cases and other sites but are not expected
to be meaningful unless combined with other smokng related cancers or
all incident cancers.

the period 1977-1982 are presented. Among females the largest category
Of cancers is breast cancer loPcrened by utenne cancer and then colo-

The stratified analyses were repeated for the 9.378 noel-smokers and the

cancers exckicteg and including lung cancor cases respectivefy. The age
adjusted rate rabos for the main exposure variable of interest were
lower than those reporte-d the previous table for al females. For the
outcome excloching kmg carimis the adjusted RR was 1.06 (45% CI 0.47.

adjusted rate ratio was 1_22 (95% C.I. 0.61-2.44). p-057.
The conditional maxrnum 'keit-rood intirnate of the rate rabo of a/1
smoking related cancers for non-srroolong females married to smokers
compared to those mamad to hon-srnokans was 1.18 (95% C.1. 0.57-2.33).
p =0.83. Table 6.7 compares this condi:Jona:I maximum Irkeihcod estimate
and exact confidence ritervals with the Maritig-Heens.zol RR estimate and
conficiere rtervals. Based on these results it would appear that
passive smoking exposame in this cohort of non-smokers has irentrnal
effect on the combined smokin related cancers. 1-k7wever, some factors
associated with education lw, spouse occupation, and age marred
appear to alillueriCO the risk of terra cancers.

most of these cases. The largest category was far txeast cancer and
the second highest was for uterine cancers. A number of these cacags
were not available tor analysis because of missing expdaLre data for
those subtects.
Table 7.1 shows the distribution ot these ncident cases. person years
and incidence rates by age group tor subiect and spouse smoking status.
As might be expected, there wts an incsaasing trend in the rates over
the age croups. in the non-smolang female cohort the rates for yeomen

73 SUMMARY
For tamales In the Woose pass cohort there is a slight increased risk of
all incident cancers associated with passive snxecing exposure. Althougn
this is only a alicahr increased risk, it is observed In both the total
female cohort as wel as the non-srnoking female cohort. The +elect
statl p-erststs n the total female cohort when the analysis controLs for
smoking status. For the Al-SMOG cohort, the results are somewhat
mued. tt appears that Living with a smoker for thàs groulo has no alleot
on the incidence cif cancers as a %%Irak,. In both the females and the
males there is a aright increased risk cd atout 2C% for working with a
smoker. These should be considered as an equivocal resat it is

possible that this increas.ecl risk may be associated with some rimer risk
factor related to empioyrnent and not considered in this anatysis. For
males there appears to be a protective etfect for high consumpoon of
beta carotene foods and there was an increased risk associated wen
higher leveis of exposure to air polutares. We wouki not expect to find
a marked increased risk from passive sitloking exposure for al incident
cancers el this population save the smakin; related cancers are a small
proportion of the total incident cancers_

CHAPTER 8: MORTALITY RESULTS
In this charges, for bath the tamale spouse oars and the AHSMOG
cohorts, we repdtrt the results of the association of passive smoking
exposure wrth Eat cause rhortisity and ischemic heart disease mortality.
The 14.antel-1-taenszel stratified anafysia miathcx1, adjusting (or age, is
used to calculate the risks associated with various exposure factors. In
attrition to the main passive smoking exposure lamas of interest, where
data W2S av-ailabie, other nsk factors normally assaaaled with ischerrso
heart dtsease were akso analyZed. While it may have been appropruate to
have considered saturated fel consurapton as a nsk factor for !HD
rnortality, art in of dietary tat was not avaiLable tor the anatyses.

Eighty seven of these were among the non-smoking fernate cohort.
Table 8.4 presents the distrbution of Mese deaths. ischernic heart
disease deaths, by age group and sect and spouse smoking status. As
with the an cause mortally results there is an overal trend of nsk
associated with the husband smoking status, atlhougti this as not
consistent across the various individual strata.
Table &5 descnbas the age adjusted results lot various exposure lectors
regaled to ischernic heart disease. For 814 outcome the passive smoking
variable used was husbands smoking status in marnage. We wished to
determine whether women married to current cigarette smokers were at
greater risk compared to those married to a past smoker or never
smoker. There was no increased risk for women married to past
smokers as compared to never smokers. adjusted rate ratio 0.96 (95% CI

To provide some measure of the level Of misclassification in tne passive

1,829 temales who were also in the Ai-LSMOG cohort arid had cornpieted
the 1987 questionnaire, (n this queslionnaire, subie-cts were asked

quessionnarre. 962. of the responses were ri agreement On the other
hand. 5.94 whom we had consnlered exposed, stated that they,wete not
mamed to a spouse who smoked whereas 5.8% now stated that they had
been exposed when we had dassilied them es unexposed. While this may
be a biased sample, and or again there is no way to check on the
valickly at these last responses, it does suggest some masdassalecation of
exposure which. d non-differential, would tend to bias the late ratios
toward the nuil.

Fraf the AHSMOG cohort we were also able to check on the reliability a
responses by uung data from the 1987 questonnare and cornparmg rt to
the respores from the 1977 crjestionnaire, 1,574 males and 2.974
females responded to bath Al-iSMOG questIonnaires. We used the
responses from questIon 35 and as From the 1977 questionnaee and
responses from que-stion 35 and 47 ul the 1987 question.nalre to classify
subjects who stated whether they had ived or worked with A SMOkai.
Table 9.4 g ries the percentage of agreement between the two
184
566405325

questionnaires tor mese two variables. We note that only 71% of males
and 78% of lermaSits had exact agreement fa lived with a smoker, and
even less tor the variable worked with a SmOker, males E3% and females
68%. This iusl highlights the tact that there is the potental for
considerable mrsClassrlicatiar of these two variables that ware used irt
the analysis. Althotign this is only a sarnpie of the original cohort if
the entire cohort followed the same clksinbution. we wou'id expect that
the rresclassiication would be non-cifferenhal. We would expect tben
that the tTue relative risk esbmate for any effect of exposure of living
or working with a smoker woukl be greater than that actually observed
in this cohort.
In addction to these considerations stated above. there are other
possibikbes of misclassification or underestimation of exposure in these
cohorts. The uneigoosed spouse pairs lernaies are unlicely to be truly
Ctilli7cpoged, since they may have been exposed to ETS in a work
ermroriment during chikthood. On the other hand, those that we
consider evosed by virtue01 living wrth a smoker may not in reality be
exposed. smoo they may avoid the environments where other people
actu.aty smoke. Since smoking is a churc.h prescription Adventist
church members are very much aware ot the adverse affects of smoking
and even sbotzes whO may not be members may be more considerate of

The rate ratios vaned from 1.01 for AHSMOG females who worked 1-10
years with a srmker to 2.01 for the spouse pees females vrho lived with
a husband who smoked. NO(10 of the 953/4 confidence intervals excluded
the null.
We recognaia that these sionmery rate nitios are sub?ect to instability
because of the marl number of ctagnosed cases in each of the cohorts.
There were oNy eight cases of lung cancer for spouse pars females and
tar the AHSMOG toner' six cases for tamales and seven =Vas for the
makes. is also norecl that a number of the exposure categories tor the
AHSMOG cohort do not have any cases of lung cancer. As a
consequence, R is only possible tO observe a dose response relationship
among the AHSMOG females for the variable. 'years worked wilt a
smoker'. For the spouse pars female non-smokers, there is same
indication of a dose response relabonsho when we consider the other
passive wicking variable, husband smoking status in marriage, where the
summary rate ratio tor past smokers was 1.69 and for cur-rent smokers
3.37 (see Table 5.5). Wrile those resorts coutd be interpreted for elther
I positive or negative effect. there is a positive trend across each of
the cohorts for an adverse affect of passive smoliziN associated wh
lung cancer. These rate ratios are of slimier magnitude to other resutts
that have been reported from case control and cohort studies.
189
5664 osaao

tt is entirely possible that these results cduk:t also be explained by
sysiorriatiC thaS Or rase:kat confouricing. By reistncting the spouse pairs
females to non-smokers, we endeavored to control for any elect 01
active smoking. Other potential confounders that were not available tot
analysts vrera o-mupationat exposures., a valid measure of oratectrve
dietary nutrients and exposure la other owl:IL:sew products and air
pollutants_ The orte exposure factor Inai dad approach stallstical
significance was 'spouse cicoJpation' with a relative nal( of 4.32 It( tdue
colter workers compered to white collar workers. Thts may be an
inclicalor for education, soclaeconerrec status or be related to an other
unknown exposure. No effect was seen for the V&Cy crude measures of
a beta-carotene index arid the triit index which we thought might
measure some protective activity.
n was not too stxpnsing that adenocarcnoma was the most predommant
histological type of lung cancer seen ii oix cohorts. Other studies
INicals that azienocarcinorria occurrs more frequeney in non-smoking
popuLabons than do other testologic types of lung cancer (Pershagen
1987). Trichopoulos (1981, 19.E13) resin:clad has Ca$41-Cantrol study to
histological types other than edenomrcinorna and showed both dose-
response relationship and a strong adverse etfe-ct. Otter studies have
also shown greater effect for squarnous cell carcitoma than for
190
566405331

adenocarcinomas (Dalaga 1986. Koo 1985), Therefore, the lack of
constsKincy of effect it the two cohorts may be clue to the fact thai
we have mostly adenocaronomas for this group as we as to the small
number or cases and the possible misClassification of passive smokmg
exposure which would bias the eistmate towards the null
9.3 SMOKING RELATED CANC.ERS
To tillable comparison between the different cohorts, Tables 6.7 and 6.18
have been sumrnanzed xi Table 9.5. For each of the cohorts the resuts
include lung cancer cases.. When lung cancer cases are excluded from
the analyses there is no noticeable effect for the female cohorts.
For the spouse pats female non-smokers, the summary rate ratio
estimate is 1.18 (95: C.1. 057-2.33). This RR is reduced to 1.06 (95%
C.1. 0.47-2.36) when lung cases are excluded from the anaNsis. 11 is
4/Parent for this cohort that passive smoking exposure has no effect on
increasing risk for smoking related cancers in general. As is noted in
the next section. ETS exposure is associated with an increase in nsk for
cervical cancer, one of the simoking related cancers included in this
analysis. Therefore, although separate analyses were riot conducted
exotic:frig cervical cancer, it is suggested that the increased nsk
observed in this lemate cohort for smoking related cancers r5 primarily
191
566405332

due to the influence of the cervical cancers. Other vanables that were
slicanthy associated with V* increased risk or srnolong related
cancers are e-cluattxinal level, ago of marriage and spouse occuPatical-
All of these are very stron* associated with increased risk of ceivical
CallCed. There is no suggestion of a pc otective effect of bela-carotene
in this particular cohort.

566405334

In the AHSMOG cohort there appears to be an incse a sed risk for males
Irving and worlung with smokers. but we do not see the same
tea is tor the female group. When there is adiuslment tor botn
age and smoking among the AHSMOG females. we obtain a sv3niticain1
chi-square value for heterogeneity. This indicates considerable RR
differences across strata indicating that the summary estrnates are not
especially meaningful. F-or the males. educational level is a sagnificant
risk factor tor these diseases and there is a suggestion that exposure to
oradants and total Suspended particulates also increase the risk of
disease. However. these au pollutiOn exposures are only lot the period
1966-1977 and are very crude estimates of exposure. For the tamale
AHSMOG cohort none of the vanables tested showed any relatronshro to
the outcome. AD:hough Mere is plausibirty tor an effect of ETS. by
combining the Other Smoking related diseases with lung cancer. the
magnitude of that effect is likely to be small. The small number of
cases and the possrble misctassilication of ETS exposure restrict our
caoacrty to observe a signitioant &tact in this group.
9.4 CERVICAL CANCER
One (Di rile most interesting outcomes of this study was the friding crl
an increased risk ci cervical cancer tor women married to smokers. In
Table 6.12 we presented a comparison 01 tne adjusted rate rauos of
194
566405335

cervical Cancer controtang or different nsk factors_ The most
prominent increase in nsk is noted tor spouse blue collar occupations.
A lower educational level and berry married at a younger age are also
highly significant. Hasite-VIN, the effect of an ricreased nsk for being
married to a smoker persists when these other factors are' Individually
controlled to, in the analysis-
Sandler (1985) found a doubkry of risk for women married to Spouses
who smoked as did Buckley (Isei), but Krrayama (1983) did not find such
an effect. As with the case-Control study by Sander. wit were unable
to take to account other risit factors such as muttiple sexual partners
of sublect and spouse, early age of sexual intercourse. soxuaily
transmitted diseases and viral infections associated wrai S. rt s quart
possible that one or mote of these factors are colfounding the etteCts
of spouse occupation and b-eing marned to a husband who smok.
However, if such an effect of spouse smoking truty exists for cervical
cancer, we hypothesize that the causal activrty may not be with the
inhalation of passive smoke but rather the consequence of being married
to a smoker in association with other risk factors. Constituents of
tobacco. notably nocotine and its rnetabolttes. have been identified ri
vanous body Ilurtis such as serum. saliva and ume. They have also
been identiked in cervical mucosa. II is biologically ptausible that
19.5
566405336

carcanogens assocratect with tobacco are transported in the male se-men
and deposzted near the cervix during sexuai activity. The rneth.anism of
carcinagenescs may require end to be at certain critical time penods and
in es.soctation with other risk facto(s,
9.5 ALL. INCtIDEKT CANCERS
Tate 9.6 preserrs a si.rnmaryot ES exposure and ttS relationship to a
incident cancers. There is some suggestion or a 2O. increased nsk for
the non-srnoksng tamales married to a smoker and kw tooth females and
males in the A.H:St.4.0G cotwxts who work with smoker. S;irrrnary RR
estimates are of a si-nrial magnitude to those reported by Hrrayama

Whole we have controlled lor confounding by age aria smoking status..
there is likely to be some residual confounding for which we have not
accounted. Greater hours of exposire to oxidaras, and TSP, were
associated wan an rocreasecl risk for mates but not fornaies of the
AHSMOG cohort, A significant dose-response relationship lor lower
levelS of beta-carotene was also noted for the males but not females.
This may be an artifact or associated with some other factor or a may
be a real effect. The association of both the ar pollutants and beta-
carotene variables with all cancer incidence deserve lunher
investigation.
9.6 140F1TALI1Y RESULTS
Tables 3.7 and 9.8 present the relationship of passive smoke exposure
and at natural cause mortality and ischerric heaft disease mortality
respectively. The summary rate ratios are adjusted for age orry. For
all cause mortality the results are not consistent among the various
cohorts. For ether females or males living with or married to smokers
Mere is no consistent piyhern of increased mortality risk. However, for
the ANSMOG females who work with smokers there appears to be an
effect; this may be real or confounded by other exposures not controbed
tor in the analysis.

A more consisress relationship is seen for fatal iv:Marne heart disease
among females cut not among males. Until further anaiyses are

Confirm the results reported in cifixer studies (Firayarna 1983, Svendscn
1987, Hetsing I987).. Other risk factors for IHD, history ol'hypertension,
diabetic cOncktion, and obesity were positively associated with the
outcome.
9.7 CONCLUSSON
The evidence nom this study for an association ol passive smoking with
the chronic disease outcomes stated in the otesdaves is somewhat
inconclusive and inconsisterrL Taking into account Via inadequate
exposure data. possible rraSolaSsification of ETS exposure and the small
number ot cases of disease, Adventist women married to spouses who
smoke appear to nave an iricseased risk oh ken mincer, cervical cancer
and all cancerS combhecL This effect is more pronounced in the spouse
pairs cohort than the AHSMCG cohort. White not convincing by
themselves, the results add evidence to the accumulation of data already
collected and support the hypothesiS that exposure to ETS has aovesse
health effects. Further studies are required to investigate the
teialionship of EIS exposure to cervical cancer and fatal and non-fatal
istherruc nean disease.

The major' limitation of this study has been the inadequate and perhaps
unreliable assessment ot passive smoking exposure data The lack oi
sufficient numbers PI cases is also a lineation. ft ia difficult  with sell-
administered questionnaires to obtain accurate measurements at ETS
exposure. This wilt continue to be the majcx criticism of °trier passive
smoking research urita a yafict objective method is found to quantity ETS
exposure in follow-up studies-

Preface
. The main muse of lung cancer is cigarette smoking-, about that the scientific
wood reported in this book leaves no doubt. Approximately 90% of the deaths
from lung ancer and almost one-third of the deaths from cancer of all kinds can
be traced directly to smoking. In 1982. about 129.000 Americans died from
smoking-related atricers, according to estimates from the Office of Smoking of
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, But cancer is not the only
disease smokers have to fear: the habit also causes elevated rates of heart
disease.
According to research reported in this vorume, about one in four regular
ciprette smokers will be killed before their time by the habit. And the magnitude
of the problem is greater than usually is realized. Of every 100 healthy young
male smokers in England. statistics predict that one will die a victim of violent
crime. two will be killed in traffic accidents, and ZS will die from a disease
brought about by cigarettes. Similar proportions of deaths will occur in the
United States, Women are quickly gaining equality with men in the lung
cancer arena: in 1982. lung cancer surpassed breast cancer as the le-ading cause
dancer deaths among warners in eight stales. The pattern, which is believed
lobe nationwide, is attributed to an increase in smoking which began among
women 30 years ago.
The cost for smokers is high in terms of dollars as well as health. In
Louisiana. where 2.100 persons die every year from lung cancer, more than
3300 million annually are spent on the purchase of cigarettes and medical
costs and loss of earnings account for approximately $586 million per year.
The state—especially its southern area—has one of the highest cancer rates in
the nation, and many of the studies in this volume look at some of the reasons.
Several papers demonstrate that smoking no longer can be considered a
personal habit concerning only smokers. Passive smoking—smoke inhaled
from nearby smokers—increases the lung cancer rate. Research conducted in
Japan has demonstrated that nonsmoking wives of heavy smokers suffer a
lung cancer risk at least twice as great as nonsmoking wives of nonsmoking
husbands. Research has also shown that radioactive materials are a common
component of cigarette smoke. Other studies in the book explore the relation-
ships of nutrition. smoking. and lung cancer: a precursor of vitamin A that
comes from green and yellow vegetables can perhaps lower cancer risks.
Smoking can work synergistically with occupational exposure to cancer-
inducing agents to increase dramatically the risk of lung cancer. Studies have
shown that some individuals may have genetic factors that make them more
susceptible to certain environmental carcinogens.

PREFACE
Cigarette smoking is a form of drug dependence because nicotine is an
addiction .causing drug. And cigarette smoking is known to UM cancer. The
addiction to this toxic drug produces many times more deaths than addictions
to marijuana, morphine, and cocaine combined_ Yet those drugs are illegal.
Why then. tlne may ask, are cigarettes advertised and sold all over the world)
When cigarette addiction began about 60 years ago. its deleterious effects on
health were not known because smoking-induced cincers can take as long as
30 years to develop. Now. cigarettes are a multibillion dollar industry with
extremely well-organized lobbies and advertising efforts. Well over 11 billion
each year are spent on efforts to promote this addictive and deadly drug that
sum is more than the total budget of the National Cancer Institute.
What can be done? Some of the research in this volume explores the
alternatives. Abolishing smoking, of course. is unrealistic, but other efforts
Mild promise. Reducing tar in cigarettes may. over the years, reduce cancer
rates, but in absolute numbers, lung cancer deaths are likely to go on increas-
ing well into the twenty-first century due to saturation marketing efforts and
increases in absolute numbers of smokers. Public education efforts about the
deadly effects of smoking are inadequate at the present time and could be made
much more effective. And legislation—with higher taxes—can make a differ-
ence_ In Finland ambitious new laws were enacted in 1977: these laws prohibi-
ted advertising and sales promotion of cigarettes; forbade smoking in all
public places except in designated areas; outlawed the sale of tobacco products
to persons under 16 years of agr reserved money from tobacco tax revenue for
developing health-oriented government tobacco policy; and made the govern-
ment responsible for establishing the limits of harmful components in
tobacco products. Finland now leads the world in reducing lung cancer
deaths, especially in younger individuals.
The best way to change smoking patterns. which would automatically
affect lung cancer occurrence. is to convince young people never to begin
smoking. Parents must be aware of their responsibilities as role models and
schools should make a health education program emphasizing the hazards of
smoking a part of instruction from kindergarten through college.
The college students from Tulane's Chapter of Alpha Epsilon Delta. recog-
nizing the hazards of smoking, helped with various phases of the conference
and continue to sponsor antismoking activities. In fact, plans for this book
began when Alton Ochsner became an honorary member of AED (the
National Pre-Medical Honor Society). We were seated around a banquet table
in a New Orleans garden district restaurant when the International Lung
Cancer Update Conference was first discussed. Dr. Ochsner planned to present
a short history of lung cancer at the conference, for as he told us "  this
disease has grown up with me. It did not exist when !was a medical student."
Unfortunately Alton Ochsner died before the conference convened, so this
volume lacks his historical perspective. Nevertheless, this book is dedicated to
the memory of Alton Ochsner and we were pleased to have his son. John
Ochsner. participate in his stead. We gratefully acknowledge the continuing
566405425

aid of the student members of AED and their antismoking efforts: as well as
the help of Diana Pinckley, Director of Tulane University Relations, and her
efficient staff for their aid in cover design and various aspects of production.
The organizers of the conference are especially indebted to Lorraine Mizell,
whose untiring work helped make the meeting a success and whose continu-
ing efforts and administrative expertise helped produce this monograph.
The conclusion is clear: cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. If scientists
and concerned citizens can communicate that simple message to the public.
the cigarette advertising salvos and lobbying efforts may all be for naught.
There will then be hope of controlling this disease.

Acknowledgments
I speak on behalf orTufane Medical Center when I say that we are pleased and
proud that Tulane University has served as one of the cosponsoring universities
of this International Lung Cancer Update Conference.
It is fitting that this monograph be dedicated to the memory of AJton Ochsner,
MD, an honorary alumnus of Tulane School of Medicine, I-ie served on the
Tulane faculty for many years as professor and chairman of surgery, prior to
establishing along with four other Tulane department heads what has become the
Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation. Dr. Ochsner, an internationally known
surgeon, dedicated his life to the elimination of lung cancer.
We have come far in the battle against lung cancer, but there is still much more
we can learn about the etiology, prevention, treatment. and ultimately the
elimination of lung cancer as a significant cause of human suffering. It is through
participation in cooperative efforts such as this international conference that we
hope to provide an exchange of information which will lead to even more
answers about rung cancer.

The conferenc e aidclressed an issue of great importance to our corn munity and
provided up-to-date presentations by some of the best international ripens in
the field. The conference has already stimulated important discussions in our
scientific community and has established an objective scientific basis to approach
the lung cancer problem in our state. I hope the impetus provided by the
conference will continue until a strategy for prevention is developed.

this dread disease and intends to promote scientific researr_h in order to addre!
this problem. Therefore the soue's 'mar with the scientific cornmuniry has bee
enhanced worldwide.
Louisiana's citizens have benefited from this conference because they receive
the most current and reputable advice from the Foremost experts in the fiel
about what they can do to enhance their chances of living lung-cancer-free live
They learned that this disease is largely self-inflicted.
Finally the scholars, scientists, and medical practitioners in Louisiana's insi

are very proud to have been involved in the planning and coordination of the
Internazional Lung Cancer Update Conference held March 3-5, 1983.
Many of the papers presented in the monograph reviewed the smoking habits
and the epiderniologic trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality in the
United States Europe. and Japan. They all repeatedly emphasized the impor-
tance of cigarette smoking as the major causative factor in lung cancer.
Environmental hazards (e.g. air pollution and asbestos) and host furors (eg.
genetics and nucrition) play a small role in the overall edology of lung ouster.
The most important conc_lusion of the International Lung Cancer Update
Conference is that an international emphasis should be placed on smoking
cessation programs aimed not only at high-risk adult populations but more
importantly as all adolescents
The only rational approach is to prevent lung cancer by geoing individuals to
either sop smoking Or never to Sian to smoke cigarettes.

A population-bed cast-comparision interview study of Jung cancer was cotiducted from
1979 to 1982 in six Texas coastal counties—Orange, Jefferson, Ghanaters, Harris, Gal-
veston, and Brasoria—to evaluate the association of lung cancer with occupational arid other
enyinxtmental mrposures. Lung cancer mortality rates in these counties consistently have ex-
ceeded lung cancer mortality rates observed for Texas and the United States from 1950-1969
so 1970-197510? both =CS and races (white and nonwhites).

recognized as possibly the most important work-related cancer. However, the in
teraction between smoking and occ-upazional exposures and the increased risk tha
may be artributed to an occupational exposure has not been very well characterize,
for a large number of workplace cep:mires.
A population-based case-comparison interview study of lung cancer, obuinini
detailed occupational histories, was conducted in six Texas coastal counties when
lung cancer mortality rates were elevated (3). Figure 1 shows the location of di(
counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Brazoria, Galveston. and Harris,
highly industrialized area where Houston is located. Approximately 25% (3.!
million) of the total state population in 1980 resided in this southeastern coasta
area, the majority (77.3%) in Harris County.
Newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed cases of lung cancer in white female:
(including Hispanic) were ascertained from July 1977 through June 1980 in Harrii
County (3 years) and from July 1976 through June 1980 for the surrounding fivt
counties. Similarly, cases among white males (including Hispanic) were aster
tithed for four years ( July 1976 through June /980) for the five less urban but in•
dustrialized counties, excluding Harris County. Background lung cancer mortalin
rates for white males and females were examined by Texas State Economic Area

the significantly higher lung cancer mortality rates observed earlier for both white
males and white females in these Texas coastal counties. The dark areas along she
upper Texas coast are the Beaumont SEA (Orange and Jefferson counties), the
Houston SEA (Harris County), and the Galveston SEA (Galveston County). Age--
adjusted mortality rates (adjusted to the 1960 United States population) in these
areas are in the top 10% of rates for SEA, in the United States and are significantly
higher than the white male or white female lung cancer mortality rate for the total
United States population. For white females in Hirri2 County, this excess was
notable for both the rate and the trend in the rate from 1950 to 1975 (4). For all
ages, combined, the overall excess in lung cancer mortality in the Texas study area
is approximately 10-40%, but this is considerably greater for some age groups.
Occupational and industrial exposures of importance for residents of the Texas
coastal area include those associated with shipbuilding and repair, chemical and

Histologically confirmed incident cases of lung cancer diagnosed among whit:
male and female residents (including Hispanic) of the study counties for th:
designated time intervals ( July 1977 through June 1980 for females in Harr!
County and July 1976 through June 1980 for males and females in other counties
were aacertained by review of hospital and state records, Hospitals in the study are,

were apntacted and asked to participate in the study. Population-based and (lett--
tient comparison subjects were 3elected frtirn state and federal records and matched
to cases on age, race, sex, vital status at time of ascertainment, and county of
residence (Harris County or other five counties). Hispanic study subjects were
identified systematically by UM of an algorithm to identify Spanish surname.
Medical records were abscracteci by state-trained abstractors to obtain relevant
disease and demographic data. Following contact with the family physician (for
eases only), persona/ interviews were, conducted with study subjects or with the
next of kin of decedent cases and mrnparison subjects, using established criteria for
!electing the most appropriate next of kin respondents. Interviews were conducted
by trained interviewers in the home using a standardized interview protocol.
Detailed information regarding the primary exposures of interest was collected,
specifically smoking history, work history. residecutial birtory, and drinking
history.
Industries of employment were coded to the Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) (6) and occupations were coded using the Diztiorary of Occupstianal Tide (7).
The Mantel-Haenszel summary chi-square and odds ratio statistics were calculated
(8). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using the method of Miertinesn (9).
Results
A total 01 55 of the 67 hospitals in the six-county Texas study participzued in the
study, including all of the seven large hospitals (500 or more beds). Ten of the 11
smaller hospitals that did not participate were located in Harris County. Therefore
we were able to ascertain 92.2% (1520 cases) of the total 1649 incident white male
and female lung canter cases (including Hispa.nic) estimated for the 3- to 4-year in-
terval (mid-1976 or 1977 to mid-1980). The number of incident cases was esti-
mated by adjusting age-race-sex-county mortality razes by popuLation growth and
an incidence: mortality ratio of 1.35:1.0. Case ascertainment was hight-t for resi-
dents of counties other than Harris County, 97.2% vs 82.1% (Tabic 1). A total of
766 female arid 754 male C41$C3 were ascertained representing, respectively, 88.7
and 96.1% of the total estimated incident cases ascertained Hispanic females ap-
pear to be poorly ascertained (38.1%), but this may be related to the classification
based on Spanish surname which may not be an effective technique for ascertain-
ing married Hispanic females.
All ascertained CAW, will be used for determining age-race-sex and county lung
cancer incidence rates for the study area. A total of 88.9% of the ascertained cases
were included in the interview study. Some cases (110, or 7.2%) lacked histologic
or cytologic confirm:1nm of lung cancer and were ineligible for the case-
comparison study. For the majority of these cases (79, or 71.8%) the basis of the
lung cancer diagnosis was radialogie or clinical evidence. There was insufficient

ject refusal rates were 7.7% and 10.7% for decedent cases and controls respec-
tively, and 13.5% and 20.6% for living cases and controls, respectively. A total of
935 interviews was completed with eligible cases (460 females and 475 males) arid
948 interviews with frequency snatched comparison subjects (Table 2). Included in
these totals are 26 Spanish surname cases and 39 comparison subjects. Separate
analyses are not presenter] at this time for these study subjects.
The average duration of time study subjects resided in the county of diagnosis or
in the six-counry study area is over 25 years for all study groups. The majority of
bath male (86%) and female (82%) cases were decedent cases and were slightly
older as time of diagnosis than the living cases (Tables 3 and 4). The distribution of
age at diagnosis is compared for male and female study groups in Figure 4. A
higher proportion of the female cases was diagnosed before age 60(43.4%) than
malt cases diagnosed before age 60(34%).

Proportions of male and female cases and comparison subjects using tobacco,
cigarettes, alcohol, or who "ever lived with household member who smoked
regularly" are compared in Table 5. Ninety-seven percent of the male cases and
91% of the female cases reported ever smoking cigarettes but a higher proportion
of the female than male cases reported smoking cigarettes currently, 68% VI 54%.
Proportions of heavy smokers and use of alcohol (ever) were higher for eases than
comparison subjects and for males than females. An extremely high proportion of
both fernale cases and comparison subjects report having lived with a household
member who smoked regularly. 93% vs 88%.
Although the patterns of risk differed for malts and females (Table 6), the odds
ratio's for a2 smoking variables were statistically significant at the p . .05 level.
Among males, ex-smokers had a risk higher than current smokers, whereas in
females the risk was lower in ex-snacAcers, The highest odds ratio for females VMS

male and female study groups into smokers (ever) and nonsmokers (never) and ex-
amining the adjusted odds ratios, there was no significant increase in risk associated
with passive smoking. In fact, the odds ratios for nonsmokers living with a regular
smoker were not increased for either males or females, 0.52 and 0.78, respectively.
However, odds ratios for smokers living with a regular smoker were increased, al-
though not significantly, 1.28 and 1.80 for males and females. The overall odds ra-
tios (adjusted) associated with passive smoking were only slightly increased and not
significant for either males or females, 1.2 and 1.3, respectively. When the possibility
of a "passive smoking" effect was examined among nonsmokers by number of yew"
lived with a regular smoker, there was very little difference in risk for females who
lived with a regular smoker for 0-32 years (Table 8). The odds ratios for males sug-
gest an increase by are based on smaller numbers than the analysis in females.

The risk associated with smoking was examined by cell type, specifically cc

nonaclenocarcinorna cases (Tables ICI and 11). The odds ratios for srnoki
categories based on pack-years were all significant, emphasizing the increased r
of lung cancer (all types) associated with smoking. However, the gradient of risk.

iclenocarcinorna in the male series and 139 in the female series. A much steeper in-
ere.= in risk associated with lifetime cigarette dose (pack-years) 13 observed for all
other lung cancer cell types compared to adenocarcinorna. These patterns are sum-
marized in Figure 5.
Preliminary analyses of the detailed work histories is based on the usual occupa-
tion and usual industry of employment as reported or as summarized from the
work history for self and spouse Examination of the work histories indicates that
approximately 78% of the study subjects spent more than half of their reported
working time employed in the occupation reported as their usual occupation. Usual
industry of employment was determined by selecting the industry in which a sub-
ject was reported to have been employed for the longest duration of time. Odds
ratios, adjusted for smoking (ever/never) were determined to identify whether an
increased risk was associated with employment in a given occupation or industry
for both males and females. Using the Professionallrechnical category as a referent
for males (odds ratio - 1), none of the odds ratios for the other occupational
categories was signific.andy increased (Table 12). Odds ratios (OR) for usual in-
durcry of employment were similarly calculated using the sales category (SIC
50-59) as the referent (OR - 1.0) (Table 13). Significantly elevated odds ratios
were observed for several industrial categories, specifically construction (SIC
15-17), chemical manufacturing (SIC 28), metal manufacturing (SIC 33-34), and
transportation (SIC 40-49). In addition, an elevated odds ratio (OR - 2.44) of
borderline statistical significance (at the .05 level) is observed for oil and gas extrac-
tion (SIC 13).

There were too few observations in the remaining categories for a meaningful
analysis. A similar analysis of usual industry of employment for females indicated
no categories of concern except for the possible exception of the increase noted for
the category of other manufacturing (Table 15).
Smoking-adjusted odds ratios were also examined for the usual occupation and
industry of employment for the spouses of both males and females. The only
significantly increased odds ratio observed was for the usual industry of employ-
ment for spouses of female lung cancer cases. The Construction industry, with 145
cases and controls reporting this as the usual industry for their spouse, was
associated with an increased odds ratio of 1.74 (1.04, 2.92; 4.40).

high-rise construction. For both males and females a large number of cases and
controls reported having a household member employed in a shipyard or in ship-
building. but this was not associated with an increased odds ratio (1.12 for males
and 1.02 for females) (Tables 16 and 17). Among males there were no statistically
significant increases); however, the odds ratios for asbestos manufacturing, insula-
non manufacturing, and coal mining are increased. Similarly, for females the odds
ratio is increased for insulation manufacturing and high-rise construction but not
significandy.
Discussion
The availability of fairly large numbers of male and female incident lung cancer
cases and comparison subjects in an interview study with detailed occupational
Isiszories provides an important basis for examining the contribution of occupa-
dcmal exposures to lung cancer in males and females. Recognising the strong in-
in lung cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking, such analyses need to
control for smoking differences. Our preliminary analysis of usual occupation and
industry of employment with a broad smoking adjustment (ever/never) indicates
several occupational and industrial associations that need to be pursued in future
analyses. Specifically, odds ratios are significantly increased for usual employment
in several industries (construction, chemical, metal, and transportation) for males
and the clerical occupations for females. In addition, there are several associations
suggested by increased odds ratios, which are not statistically significant. For
males, an increased risk is suggested for occupations in the structural category and
employment in industries related to oil and gas extraction (SIC 13), petroleum
refining (SIC 60-69), arid shipbuilding (SIC 373). For females, occupations in the
StrifiCt category and industries in the other manufacturing group are associated
with fairly stable increased odds ratios.
Future analysis of these data will examine the possible interaction of smoking
with occupational and industrial groups and a possible need to employ more
specific smoking strata. Examination of odds ratios for smoking strata within oc:
cupational and industrial categories suggested that an ever/never smoking
classification would be sufficient to control for the confounding effect of smoking in
the examination of overall risks associated with usual employment in specific oc-
cupational and industrial categories as presented here. However, this broad
classification may not be sufliciendy specific for an examination of interaction of
smoking with workplace exposures. In these analyses the classification of
"exposed" within a specific category is hued upon the "usual" occupation or in-
dustry of employment rather than "ever employed" in a given work environment.
The use of the usual pattern may be more conservative in the detection of occupa-
tional and industrial associations and is perhaps the more appropriate designation
to use for a preliminary examination of the data. As noted, the use of the usual oc-
cupation and industry of employment did introduce some special constraints on the
analysis of the female patterns in that the usual occupation and industry for over
566405444

60% of the cases and contre., was "Housewife." We will employ a number
more specific designations of occupational and industrial variables in futu:
analyses.
Even with these recognized limitations, the suggestion which dearly =erg,
from our data is that there may be a wider variety of workplace exposuri
associated with substantial increments in the risk of lung cancer than current
recognized. In addition, use of the full work history, including dates will surely L
in refining the preliminary associations reported here.
The relationship of lung cancer cell type with age at time of diagnosis warran
further scrutiny in that the highest odds twins for the smoking variables we:
observed for the youngest age group (< 57 years ar time of diagnosis). The lack of
"passive smoking" effect when the confounding effect of smoking of
study subjects is considered, is not consistent with early reports. Although sub*
quent reports are also not consistent with regard to this association, it may be du
the study population available was not sufficiently large to detect a fairly low lev,
effect and that this association needs to be assessed in a considerably larger stud
population.
These preliminary analyses demonstrate a strong and consistent smoking effet
in males and females for all types of lung cancer. The risk differentials associate
with cigarette smoking observed for adenocarcinoma and other lung Ca130:2 cc
types are striking and consistent with findings Mothers (11). In addition, the
reemphasize earlier suggestions that perhaps specific environmental exposures am
more strongly associated with specific types of lung cancer. In addition, these tiat
suggest that perhaps lung cancer is more similar in males and females tha:
previously regarded and that the observed differentials in risk by sex are principall
due to exposure differentials.

gave very similar estimates.
There are a number of reasons why it was decided not to usc data from
this study in the more detailed assessment of the results for lung cancer
given in Chapter 3;
(i) The study was designed to investigate possible effects of radon and not
ETS and, as such, the controls, which contained many with smoking-
related diseases, were not appropriate.
(ii) it is not stated whether the ETS findings were based on never smokers,.
nun-smokers or the whole population
(iii) Results are not given for males and females separately.
(iv) Numbers of ETS exposed and unexposed cases and controls are not
given.
2.4.3 Colorado Case- contra! Study of /idenocaremoma Brownson
Using the Colorado Central Cancer Registry, Brownson etal. [581 identified
149 microscopically confirmed cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and
169 age- and sex-matched controls with cancers of the colon or bone mar-
row diagnosed during 1979-82. Interviews were carried out with 102 cases
(68%) and 131 controls (78%), in which information on smoking. ETS,
occupation, social status, and exposure to air pollution was collected. Four
male and 19 female cases reported never having smoked Risk of adenocar-
cinoma was estimated to be 1.68 times higher among female never smokers
who reported E'I'S exposure for 4 or more hours per day than among those
who reported exposure for up to 3 hours per day. This relative risk, which
was adjusted for age, income and occupation, was not statistically signifi-
cant (95% confidence limits, 0.39-2.97). Data were collected on smoking
by the spouse, but results were not reported for never smokers.
While the study has the advantages that it concerns a single histologi-
cal type, microscopic confirmation has been obtained for all cases. and it
has an appropriate control group. it is severely limited by the small num-
ber of non-smokers studied. The high non-response rate is also a problem,
as is the fact that a higher proportion of interviews for the case group
(69%) titan for the control group (39%) were completed by a relative or
friend.

at-home Interviews for 935 of them. Interviews were also conducted for 948
population-based and decedent comparison subjects selected from state and
Federal records and matched to cases on age, race, sex, vital status at time of
ascertainment, and county of residence_ Interviews were conducted with the
subjects who were alive and with the next of kin of those who were not.
Among subjects who had never smoked, the risk of lung cancer was non-
signific.antly reduced in those circumstances where a household member
smoked regularly compared with those where no household member
smoked regularly (Table 2.20) No relationship as seen when risk was
related to duration of exposure to a household member who smoked. No
analyses were presented in relation to F.TS exposure broken down by histo-
logical type or by type either of control or of respondent.
One problem with this study relates to the fact that no attempt seems
to have bccn made to exclude from the study decedents with smoking-
associated diseases Also, a very high proportion of information was
obtained from next of kin, with the subject providing data only for 14% of
mates and 21% of females. 'Mager et al [60] include results from this

In the study by.Kabat and WvndeL-1.561, lung
cancer patients iri six CiIICS were identified, and
controls were matched to the cases on age. sex,
race, date of interview and hospital. More care
sCern, to have b=i taken in this study than in
the others to ensure that subjects classified as
non-smokers were truly such. Interviewers used
a standardized questionnaire, but it is unclear
whether they were blinded to the status of the
patient as a case or a control.
The study of  Buffler er 1571 was conducted
in six coastal counties in Texas. Little infor-
mation is provided about such key features of
the study as the criteria for classifying the
spouse as a "regular smoker" or not, whether
ex-smokers were included or excluded, whether
the interviewers were blinded, And the number
of patients for whom a surrogate interviewer
was required.
Garfinkel et at. [58j studied cases and controls
from—hospitals in New Jersey and Ohio. Con-
trols were patients with colorectal cancer,
matched to the cases on age and hospital. The
interviewers were kept blinded to the status of
each patient. Women were counted as unex-
posed to ETS even if their husbands smoked
cigarettes "only occasionally." There was exten-
sive reliance on surrogate interviewees, many
with questionable knowledge about the patient:
approximately one quarter of all interviews were
with someone other than the patient, the spouse
or a child, about 60%, were with the spouse or
a child, and only 12% were with the patient
herself.
The case-control study by Wu er at. (59),
conducted in Los Angeles County, was the
first to use neighborhood rather than hospital-
ized controls. Only cases who were still alive
were interviewed (all on the tetephonc); i.e. no

surrogates were permitted for cases who had
died or who refused to be interviewed. No
information was provided as to whether the
interviewers were blinded. The point estimate of
the OR given by the authors in their paper's
abstract and in the text on p. 748. OR. = 1.2. is
inconsistent with the confidence interval re-
ported in both of those places, 0.5-3.3 (the
geometric mean of the limits must equal the
point estimate). Instead of working with these
incorrect values, we used in Table 2 and in Fig.
2 of this paper the values for "spouse smoked"
for adenocarcinoma in their Table 2: OR = 1,2,
with a 95% confidence interval extending from
0.6 to 2.5.
Brownson et at. (60) carried out their
case-control say in-Mirver. The controls were
patients with cancer of the colon or bone mar-
row and were matched according to age and sex
(there was approximately a 50:50 split on sex
for the patients with lung cancer). The inter-
viewer was blinded to the case or control status
of the patient. The interviewee was someone
other than the patient (mainly the spouse but
occasionally a sibling or child) for nearly 70%
of the cases and almost 40% of the controls.
Exposure to ETS was not dichotomized in their
Table 4 as "none" vs "any" but as "less than
four hours per day" vs "four or more". The
95% confidence interval for the OR there
should extend from 0.46 to 6.10 (personal com-
munication from the senior author).
The study by  Humble el al. [611 was a pop,u-
lation-based case-control stua-Fi71-ew Mexico.
Controls were obtained by random dig-it dialing
or from a randomly generated list of Medicare
recipients. They were selected to match the
freque-ncy distributions of the cases on sex,
ethnicity and age. The patient's status as a
never-smoker was checked against the infor-
mation recorded in the hospital chart. More
than half of the time a surrogate was relied on

The relation between various risk factors and adenocarcinoma of the lung was
evaluated in a Case-control study. Subjects were selected from the Colorado
Central Cancer Registry from 1979-1982 in the Denver metropolitan area. A tote!
of 102 (S0 males and 52 females) adenocarcinoma case interviews and 131 (55
males and 66 %mitts) control interviews were completed. The control group
Consisted of persons with cancers of the colon and bons marrow. The risk
estimates associated with cigarette smoking were significandy elevated among
males (odds ratio (OR) = 4.491 and females (OR = 3.95) arid were found to
Increase significarnly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of cigarette smoking for
both males and females. For adenocarclnoma in females, the age- and smoking-
adjusted Odds ratios at different levels of passive smoke exposure followed an
Increasing overall trend (p = 0.05). After additional adjustment for potential
confounders, prior cigarette use remained the most significant predictor of risk
of adenocarclrioms among males and females. Analysis restncted to nonsmoking
females revealed a risk of adenocircinorne of 1.68(95% confidence Interval (C1)
c 0.39-2.97) for passive smoke exposure of four or more hours per day. Neither
sex showed significantly elevated risk for occupational exposures, although
malts bordered on significance (OR = 2.23, 95% Cl c 0.97-5.12). The results

Recent evidence indicates that lung can-
cer may encompass several morphologically
and clinically distinct diseases (I, 2). In
industrialized western nations, incidence
rates are highest for squarnous cell carci-
noma, followed by aderiocarcinoma (3, 4).
The relation between squarnous cell and
small cell carcinomas and cigarette smok-
ing is well-established, but the relation be-
tween adenocarcinoma and cigarette smok-
ing is less clear (3, 5, 6).
Adenocarcinoma is the most frequently
diagnosed form of lung cancer in the United
States among women and nonsmokers (3,

Hied as adenocarcinoma among males com-
pared with 37 per cent among females (8).
The role of occupational exposures in the
etiology of adenocarcinoma remains incon-
clusive (9, 10). Recently, a disproportionate
increase in the incidence of adenocarci-
noma has been noted in the United States
(5). The changing histologic patterns of
lung cancer incidence may be due to a
change in diagnostic practices and classifi-
cation or to increasing exposure to environ-
mental carcinogens.
The present investigation was designed
to evaluate the role of smoking, passive
smoking, occupation, community air pol-
lution, and socioeconomic status in the
etiology of adenocarcinoma of the lung. A
case-control study was conducted to pro-
vide additional data concerning the relation
between exposure variables and this infre-
quently studied and poorly understood
form of lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cases and controls were identified
through the population-based Colorado
Central Cancer Registry maintained by the
Colorado Department of Health. For the
years and counties included, reporting was
essentially complete. All diagnoses were
microscopically confirmed and classified
according to histologic type. Study partici-
pants were required to have resided in the
Denver metropolitan area for at least six
months prior to cancer diagnosis in order
to reduce migration bias.
Case selection
A total of 149 eligible cases of adenocar-
cinoma (internationca Classification of Die-
eases(LCD) code 163) were identified in the
five-county Denver metropolitan area from
1979-1982. Selection was restricted to
white males and white females. These ad-
enocarcinoma cases were stratified by age
and sex. Of the 149 eligible cases, 31 could
not be located, 15 refused to be interviewed,
and one did not qualify. A total of 102 case
interviews (50 males and 52 females) were
completed. The mean ages for male and
female cases were 64.9 and 66,3 years, re-
spectively.
Control selection
Controls were chosen from persons in the
Colorado Central Cancer Registry who had
cancer of sites considered to be unrelated
to cigarette smoking. Specifically, persons
with cancers of the colon (ICD code 153)
and bone marrow (LCD code 169) diagnosed
from 1979-1982 were chosen as controls
and group-matched to adenocarcinorna
cases according to age and sex. Matching
was done at the group level so that the
maximum number of cases and controls
could be used in the analyses. Only whites
were included in the study, and at least one
control was required for each case within
each age and sex stratum.
A total of 169 eligible controls were iden-
tified. Of these, 24 could not be located, 13
refused to be interviewed,. and one did not
qualify. A total of 131 usable interviews (65
males and 66 females) were completed.
Among controls, 80 were colon cancer pa-
tients, and 51 were diagnosed with leuke-
mia. The mean ages for male and female
controls were 65.2 and 68.2 years, resp-ec-
tively.
Data collection and analyses
Epidemiologic data were collected by per-
sonal interview. The interviewer was un-
aware of whether the patient was a case or
a control. A higher percentage of the inter-
views in the case group (68.6 per cent) than
in the control group (38.9 per cent) were
completed by a relative or a friend. Among
the 70 nonsurviving cases, 56 interviews
were completed with a spouse, seven inter-
views with a child, six with a sibling, and
one with a close friend. For the 51 deceased
controls, information was obtained from 42
spouses, six children, two siblings, and one
close friend.
Socioeconomic status was assessed by ex-
amining two variables, education and in-
come. Educational level was characterized
by the highest grade of formal education
completed. Gross income was ascertained

for the previous year, or in case of retirees,
for the year prior to retirement.
Smoking history was characterized for
cigarettes, cigars, or pipefuls in terms of
pack-years of exposure. Passive smoking
data were analyzed as it dichotomous vari-
able based on the smoking status of the
patient's spouse and as a stratified variable
based on the hours per day that the subject
was in the presence of persons who were
smoking.
Occupational data were analyzed accord-
ing to industrial category, occupational cat-
egory, and a self-assessment of the expo-
sure of the respondent to known lung
carcinogens in the workplace. Those indus-
tries and occupations known to be associ-
ated with an elevated risk for lung cancer
were coded and multiplied by the number
of years in each category to estimate expo-
sure over time (11-13). In addition, each
subject was shown a list of 12 groups of
materials known to be lung carcinogens and
was asked whether he or she had been
*spored to the substances during a partic-
ular occupation. Pulmonary carcinogens
included materials such as asbestos, chro-
mium, nickel, uranium ore„ and mustard
pa. Positive responses were coded as inte-
gers and summed.
An index of exposure to community air
pollution was developed based on estimated
levels of total suspended particulates per
census tract and the years of residence in
each census tract (14). Total suspended
Particulate air pollution, which contains a
benzene soluble fraction, was used as an
indicator of polycyclic hydrocarbon (e.g.,
benzo(alpyrene) levels. The total sus-
Fended particulate data were stratified into
10 air pollution exposure subgroups, and
each census tract within the Denver area
was assigned to a subgroup. The residence
code consisted of years at each residence
multiplied by the corresponding total sus-
pended particulate exposure subgroup.
In the first set of arutlyses, stratified con-
tingency tables were constructed to adjust
for age and smoking for the primary risk
factors (15-17). Odds ratios for each level
of exposure were calculated by Miettinen's
standardized rate technique which controls
for confounding factors (18). All analyses
included adjustment for age based on the
categories 30-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and
80-99 years. An extension of the Mantel-
Haenszel procedure was used to statisti-
cally evaluate overall trends in the propor-
tion of cases according to level of exposure
to risk factors (19, 20).
Multiple logistic regression was used to
obtain maximum likelihood point and in-
terval estimates of the odds ratio, as well
as to control for the effects of various con-
founding risk factors (21-23). The most
significant predictors, based on the Mantel-
Haenszel results. were included in the lo-
gistic model. The dependent variable in
these analyses was lung adenocarcinoma
(case (coded as 11 or control (coded as O)).
Independent variables were entered in in-
tervals, as recommended by Schlesselman
(241. In order to identify the potential con-
founding effect of the induction period of
cancer, the exposure of each case or control
to ambient air pollutants and industrial
carcinogens was analyzed in two ways: 1)
the entire residence and work history of
each person was included, and 2) only ex-
posures that took place 10 or more years
prior to the time of diagnosis were consid-
ered. The analyses were completed both for
all subjects and for primary respondents
only, to assess the validity of the surrogate
interview data. A multiple logistic regres-
sion model was also constructed for non-
smoking female cases and controls.
RESULTS
For both miles and females, the age-
standardized odds ratios were found to in-
crease significantly (p < 0.01) with increas-
ing levels of prior cigarette use (table 1).
The age-adjusted odds ratio for prior ciga-
rette use among males was 4.49 (95 per cent
confidence interval (Cl) 1.44-13.981.
Among females, the risk due to cigarette
smoking was 3.95 (95 per cent Cl 1,76-
8.80). For adenocarcinoma in females, the

different levels of passive smoke exposure
followed an overall trend, statistically sig-
nificant at the 0.05 level. The age- and
smoking-adjusted odds ratio for passive
smoke exposure (using 0-3 hours per day
as the reference level) was 1.01 (95 per cent
Cl = 0.42-2.41) among males. The corre-
sponding risk for females was 2.42 (95 per
cent CI = 0.94-6.22). Odds ratios for pas-
sive smoke exposure were also calculated
on a yes/no basis for the regular smoking
history of the patient's spouse. The aden-
ocarcinoma risk from smoking by the
spouse was not significant for males (odds
ratio (OR) = 1.40, 95 per cent CI = 0.66-
2.14) or females (OR = 1.54, 95 per cent CI
= 0.72-2.35).
The odds ratios and their 95 per cent
confidence intervals for education level, in-
come, community air pollution exposure
history, and occupational exposures are
presented in table 2. The lowest level of
each variable was used as the reference
category. Both education and income
showed inverse trends with adenocarci-
noma risk. Among males, annual income
approached statistical significance with an
odds ratio of 0.47 (95 per cent CI =- 0.19-
1.19). No significant risks in the age- and
smoking-adjusted odds ratios were shown
for males or females according to their air
pollution exposure history. No difference
was noted regardless of whether the entire
residence history of the patient or only the
residence history 10 or more years prior to
cancer diagnosis was used in the analysis.
Of the occupational variables (industrial
category, occupational category, or self-re-
ported exposure to lung carcinogens), only
occupational exposures for males bordered
on significance (OR = 2.23, 95 per cent CI
= 0.97-5.12).
The multiple logistic regression risk es-
timates for income, occupation, pack-years
of cigarette use, and passive smoke expo-
sure are shown in table 3. For both sexes
combined, annual income showed an in-
verse association with adenocarcinoma risk
after adjustment for other risk factors (OR
= 0.85, 95 per cent Cl = 0.72-0.98). A
positive association between pack-years of
cigarette use and cancer risk was found for
males, females, and both sexes combined.
The largest risk for adenocarcinoma asso-
ciated with passive smoking was shown for
females at the exposure level of 4-7 hours
per day (OR 2. L91, 95 per cent CI 0.78-
3.03). The first-order interaction of pack-
years of smoking and passive smoking was
examined and found to be nonsignificant.

DISCUSSION
Numerous case-control studies of lung
cancer have been conducted over the past
30 years. Few, however. have examined the
data according to histologic type. There
appears to be a general consensus that the
various histologic types of lung cancer have
a multifactorial etiology which includes cig-
arette smoking and occupational and other
environmental factors.
Smoking is the major risk factor for most
types of lung cancer. In the United States.
it is estimated that cigarette smoking may
contribute to at least 80 per cent of lung
cancer in males and 40 per cent in females
(25). Several reports have suggested that
smoking may not be the major risk factor
for adenocarcinonia in certain populations
(26-28). Among white males, the age-
standardized relative risk estimates for
lung adenocercinoma according to prior
cigarette use have ranged from less than
one at low levels of smoking to about six at
high levels of smoking (3, 29). Risk esti-
mates of adenocarcinorna from smoking for
females are commonly lower and vary
widely among racial groups; for example,
the relative risk estimates range from about
one m Chinese women to four in Japanese
women, and five in Hawaiian women (26,
30). The risk of smoking and adenocarci-
noma for white females is usually between
one and three, although the risk of lung
cancer by histologic type has been studied
less frequently among females than among
males (10, 30-32)
The current study found significant risk
estimates for adenocarcinorna associated
with smoking of 4.49 for males and 3.95 for
females. The age-standardized risk esti-
mates at different levels of cigarette use
showed significant trends (p < 0.01) for
males and females, indicating that a dose-
response relation between smoking and ad-
enocarcinoma was present. The risk esti-
mates based on multiple logistic regression
analyses for smoking were generally lower
than the odds ratios calculated by the
methods of Mantel and Haenszel (15) and
Miettinen (17), since logistic regression al-
lowed for adjustment for multiple factors.
The risk estimates for smoking and ade-
nocarcinoma found in this study and the
presence of a dose-response relation were
consistent with other studies (n, 31, 33).
The effect of involuntary inhalation of
sidestream smoke (passive smoking) on
lung cancer etiology is a controversial cur-
rent public health issue (34). Hirayama (35)
reported a significant relative risk for lung
cancer of 2.08 among wives of heavy smok-
ers. A study conducted among Greek
women found relative risks of 2.4 and 3.4
for wives of light and heavy smokers. re-
spectively (36). A case-control study in
Louisiana identified an increased risk for
lung cancer among nonsmokers married to
heavy smokers and for subjects whose
mothers smoked (37). Garfinkel et al. (38)
found an increased lung cancer risk for
women whose husbands smoked 20 or more
cigarettes per day. A recent study in Los
Angeles found a slight increase in risk of
adenocarcinoma among nonsmoking
women exposed to passive smoke (39). Sev.
era] other studies have failed to link passive
smoke exposure to an increased risk of lung
cancer (40-42). Prior studies that have
evaluated passive smoking and lung cancer
have differed in the index of passive smoke
exposure, cell type, and degree of histologic
verification (34).
In the present study, indexes of passive
smoke exposure were obtained in two ways:
5664054581

RISK FACTORS FOR ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG 31
1) by ascertaining the regular smoking his-
tory of the spouse of each subject on a yes/
no basis; and 2) by determining the average
hours per day that the subject was exposed
to smoking (at home and at work). No
significant risk estimates were shown when
smoking by the spouse was considered as a
dichotomous variable. When the data were
stratified according to level of passive
smoke exposure, a statistically significant
trend in the risk estimates was shown for
females (p w 0.05) after adjustment for age
arid cigarette smoking. However, after ad-
justment by logistic regression for age, in-
come, occupation, and cigarette smoking,
no significant adenocarcinoma risk for pas-
sive smoke exposure was found among fe
males.
The relatively large proportion of non-
smoking female cases (36.5 per cent)
observed in this study suggested the impor-
tance of other risk factors in adenocarci-
noma etiology. A previous study found 19.5
per cent nonsmokers among female acle-
nocarcinoma cases (39). Our study demon-
strated a slightly elevated risk among fe-
male nonsmokers due to passive smoke
exposure, consistent with the findings of
Wu at Al. (39). Deficiencies in passive
smoking data in recent studies include: I)
no commonly established index of side-
stream smoke exposure; 2) a lack of data
on other indoor air pollutants such as ra-
don; 3) the existence of a.probable differ-
ential in accuracy of obtaining passive
smoke exposure histories between living
and deceased subjects; 4) a lack of evidence
of changes in the peripheral bronchial epi-
thelium of nonsmokers exposed to side.
stream smoke (40); and 5) insufficient
numbers of nonsmoking lung cancer cases
available for analyses. Despite these limi-
tations, the relation between passive smok-
ing and lung cancer deserves further inves-
tigation.
Although pollutants in the air have long
been suspected to contribute to the etiology
of lung cancer, epidemiologic evaluation
has been hampered by difficulties in defin-
ing and measuring air pollution and in eval-
uating the effects of confounding variables
such as smoking, occupation, and popula-
tion mobility (43). A census tract analysis
of lung cancer data, total suspended partic-
ulate air pollution, and median household
income was reported previously for the
Denver area (14). Our previous work
showed a significant direct relation be-
tween male lung cancer rates and total sus-
pended particulate air pollution ( p < 0.02)
However, for both males and females, me-
dian household income explained a larger
percentage of the variation in lung cancer
rates than did particulate air pollution.
The data on residence history of cases
and controls were analyzed to determine if
differences in total suspended particulate
air pollution exposure may have accounted
for a portion of the adenocarcinoma inci-
dence. There were only slight differences
between cases and controls in mean or me-
dian years of residence in metropolitan
Denver. Residence history was defined in
terms of exposure-years (years of exposure
to high or low total suspended particulates)
in order to define an index of exposure for
each case and control. Although, in Denver,
cases commonly experienced more expo-
sure-years, no significant differences be-
tween cases and controls were detected for
males or females. Our data failad to show
the presence of a large air pollution effect.
Occupational exposures may be impor-
tant risk factors for lung cancer (44-51).
Prior studies of lung cancer have demon-
strated an increased risk for exposure to
substances such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel,
radon daughters, diagnostic radiation, and
fossil fuel combustion products (44). Incon-
sistent findings have been reported regard-
ing the importance of occupational factors
in adenocarcinoma incidence (9, 10), In this
study, occupational risks for adenocarci-
noma were examined in two ways: 1) an a
priori listing of industries and occupations
in which workers are at high risk for lung
cancer was used to code the work history
data from each case or control; and 2) each
subject was asked if he or she was ever
exposed to a list of known lung carcinogens
566405459

in the workplace. The exposures (indus-
trial, occupational, or pulmonary carcino-
gens) were cumulated over the lifetime of
the subject, and the analysis was based on
a classification of any or no previous ex-
posure. Only high-risk occupational history
showed a borderline significant risk for ad-
enocarcinoma among males after adjust-
ment for age and smoking history. The
occupational risk was smaller after multiple
adjustment for age, income, cigarette smok-
ing, and passive smoking. The relations
between workplace exposures and adeno-
carcinoma risk were unchanged regardless
of whether the entire work history of the
subject or only the work history 10 or more
years prior to diagnosis was used.
A difference in risk for lung cancer by
social class has been observed whether
measured primarily by occupation, income,
or education (3). Part of the socioeconomic
differential in lung cancer risk is due to
smoking habits (52). In this study, educa-
tion level and gross income were used as
socioeconomic indicators. Income level
showed a stronger association with adeno-
carcinoma risk after controlling for age and
smoking than did education. Since colon
cancer is correlated with socioeconomic
status (53), it is possible that the use of
colon cancer patients as controls in this
study magnified the observed inverse rela-
tion between adenocarcinoma and income
level. No statistically significant inverse
association was noted in adenocarcinoma
risk with respect to education level, al-
though risk estimates were commonly lower
at higher educational levels.
The issue of dietary vitamin A and lung
cancer risk was not addressed in this study.
Evidence is accumulating that a deficiency
in dietary vitamin A may result in a higher
risk for lung cancer and that a higher intake
of vitamin A and its provitamins has an
apparent protective effect (28, 54-59). Diet
may be less important in our study since
recent data have snggested that the inverse
relation between vitamin A intake and lung
cancer is strong for squamous cell and small
cell carcinomas but not for adenocarcinoma
(29. 58).
This study used a higher proportion of
surrogate interviews for cases (68.6 per
cent) than of surrogate interviews for con-
trols (38.9 per cent). Several investigators
have attempted to characterize the validity
of information obtained from surrogate in-
terviews (60-62). Pickle et al. (60) found
that siblings were best able to describe
events that occurred early in life, whereas
spouses and offspring best recounted events
during adult life. Other studies have found
that bias may be introduced because of
inaccurate work histories given by next of
kin (61) and that spouses may provide ac-
curate demographic information and a
crude estimate of smoking, but details of
employment history and diet may be of
lower validity (62). To address this proh•
lem, we conducted separate analyses for all
respondents and for primary respondents.
The results were highly comparable and
indicated that some conclusions based on
all respondents may have been conservative
since adenocarcinoma risk estimates. for
passive smoking were commonly higher
among primary respondents.
In light of the changing histopathologic
patterns of lung cancer, the findings of this
and other recent studies suggest the need
to consider the various lung cancer cell
types as different diseases. Future research
should emphasize accurate histologic typ-
ing and the development of cell type-
specific etiologic hypotheses.

Passive Smoking and Lung Cancer in
Nonsmoking Women
Ross C. Bronson, PhD, Michael C. R. Alavania, DrPH, Edward T. Hock BS,
and Timothy S. Lay, MD
Introduction
Although most lung cancer occurs in
smokers, approximately 9% to 13% of
lung cancer cases in US women develop in
lifetime nonsmokers.1-6 The causes of
lung cancer in nonsmokers have not been
widely studied, but probably comprise a
diverse set of factors including genetics,
occupational factors, radon exposure,
diet, and a history of noninaliant lung
disease.
In addition to these risk factors, the
etiologic role of passive smoke exposure
has received increasing scrutiny over the
past decade. Numerous srudies-20 have
suggested an elevation in tune cancer risk
for nonsmoking females who live with a
smoker, with a summary excess risk of
approximately 30%.21-22 However, sev-
eral recent stud have shown no
increased lung cancer risk due to spousal
smoking.
Limited evidence-6 also suggests
that exposure to passive smoke in child-
hood may increase risk of lung cancer. For
example, a recent case-control study from
New York found that household exposure
to tobacco smoke during childhood of 25
or more smoker-years' duration was as-
sociated with a doubling of lung cancer
risk.
Most previous studies of passive
smoking and lung cancer, although sug-
gestive of a positive effect, have had sev-
eral deficiencies. These deficiencies in-
clude sample sizes insufficient to singly
demonstrate significant elevations in risk,
limited data on passive smoke exposure in
both childhood and adulthood, and lack of
histologic review of cases to verify lung
cancer diagnosis and to allow analyses by
cell type.
To more fully evaluate the relation-
ship between lung cancer and passive
smoke exposure in childhood and adult-
hood, we conducted a large case-control
study of lung cancer among nonsmoking
women.
Methods
Case Group
Case patients were identified through
the Missouri Cancer Registry, which is
maintained by the Missouri De pa.rtme nt of
Health. The Registry began collecting
data on incident cancer cases from public
and private hospitals in 1972, and hospital
reporting was mandated by law in 1984.
Registry reporting procedures have been
discussed in more detail e1sewhere.23 To
ensure complete reporting of lung cancer
cases in women for the current study, we
had Registry staff complete special case
ascertainment visits to participating hos-
pitals_ The case series included White
Missouri women, aged 30 to 84 years, who
were diagnosed with primary lung cancer
between January 1986 and June 1991. Se-
lection was limited to Whites because of
small numbers of other racial/ethnic

groups. The case group included both life-
time nonsmokers and ex-smokers who
had stopped smoking at least 35 years be-
fore diagnosis or who had smoked for less
than 1 pack-year. From the 3475 cases of
lung cancer in women reported for the
study period, 650 eligible patients were
identified. Physicians denied interview
permission for 24 (4%) of these patients
and an additional 8 women (1%) refused to
be interviewed. The final case group in-
cluded 432 (70%) lifetime nonsmokers and
186 (30%) ex-smokers. Of the 618 case
interviews, 216 were conducted with pa-
tients themselves and 402 were conducted
with surrogates because thc patient was
too ill lobe interviewed or hed died. Of the
surrogate interviews, 105 (26%)were con-
ducted with the patient's spouse and 297
(74%) were conducted with another rela-
tive (e.g., offspring or sibling).
Plistologic Confirmation of Cases
Tissue slides were reviewed for his-
tologic verification for 468 (76 %) of the 618
cases. Slides for these rases were exam-
ined simultaneously by three pathologists
(T.L., EL, and J.M.) using a multiheaded
microscope without knowledge of the re-
ferring pathologist's diagoosis. In surgical
specimens, consensus tisagnoses were ob-
tained with the criteria outlined in the
World Health Organization classification
scheme. :"9 When only cytologic material
was available, consensus was obtained
with standard cytologic criteria.30
Control Group
A population-based sample of con-
trol subjects was ascertained by two meth-
ods. For women younger than 65 years, a
sample of state driver's license files was
provided by the Missouri Department of
Revenue. For women aged 65 to 84 years,
control subjects were generated from the
Health Care Finance Administration's
rosterof Medicare recipients)' On the ba-
sis of age distribution of lung cancer cases
previously reported to the Registry, the
final control group was matched by age
group to case patients at an approximate
2.2 to 1 ratio. All control subjects were
interviewed directly. Of the 1862 poten-
tially eligible control subjects, 335 (18%)
refused the initial screening interview and
125 (7%) of those screened and found el-
igible refused the full interview. The final
control group numbered 1402.
Questionnaire Design and
Administration
Telephone interVievas were con-
ducted by trained interviewers. The first
1525 American Journal of Public Health
phase of the interview consisted of a
screening questionnaire to verify the age,
race, and smoking status of case patients
and control subjects. For subjects who
were screened and found eligible and who
agreed to the full interview, the study
questionnaire consisted of sections on res-
idential history, passive smoke exposure,
personal health history, family health his-
tory, reproductive history, occupational
exposure, and dietary factors.
Questions regarding passive smoking
focused on exposure in both childhood (17
years and younger) and adulthood (18
years and older). For each time period,
respondents were questioned about the
source of exposure (e.g., a parent or
spouse). After an individual source was
determined, a series of detailed questions
were asked on the type of tobacco used,
duration of exposure, intensity of expo-
sure, and average number of hours per
day exposed. These questions were par-
.-natty modeled after those developed by
Wynder et al.m In addition to quantitative
estimates of exposure, respondents were
asked to estimate a perceived level of ex-
posure during childhood and adulthood
("During most of your adult years, would
you say that your average exposure to
smoke at home was light, moderate, or
heavy?").
Analyses
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (Cs) were calculated with
multiple logistic restression.13 The linear-
ity of trends in risk according to level of
passive smoke exposure was evaluated
with Mantel's one-tailed test) m We ini-
tially examined numerous potential con-
founding factors. These included age, ac-
tive smoking (for ex-smokers), history of
previous lung diseases, dietary beta caro-
tene, and dietary fat. Of these variables,
only age, active smoking, and previous
lung disease appeared to confound pas-
sive smoking findings; therefore, the re-
sults presented are adjusted for these fac-
tors.
Histologic type-specific analyses
were conducted for cases for which con-
sensus diagnoses were determined. These
analyses were undertaken because earlier
studiess-16-= have shown variations in risk
by cell type, and biological mechanisms
have been proposed that might account
for these variations-5
Results
Sociodemoeraphic and smoking-re-
lated characteristics of case patients and
control subjects have been presented in
detail e1sewhe:e.36 In brief, the average
ages of case patients and control subjects
were 71.5 years and 69.9 years, respec-
tively. The two groups were also compa-
rable on level of education and income.
Among ex-smokers, the median interval
since cessation was 24 years, and average
smoking intensity was 16.4 cigarertes per
day.
There was little evidence of increased
lung cancer risk associated with passive
smoke exposure in childhood (Table 1).
This lack of association was apparent for
both the dichotomous variables (never vs
ever exposed) and quantitative measures
such as pack-years. The only suggestion
of elevated risk was noted for less quan-
titative exposure variables (not shown in
table). Among lifetime nonsmokers, art in-
creased risk of lung cancer was shown for
those reporting moderate (OR = 1.7; 95%
CI = 1.1, 2.5) and heavy (OR = 2.4; 95%
CI = 1.3,47) exposure to passive smoke
in childhood. Risk estimates for most
childhood exposure variables were
slightly higher (approximately 20% to
50%) when analyses included only direct
interviews, although none achieved statis-
tical significance.
An elevated risk of lung cancer was
identified for lifetime nonsmokers at the
highest quartile of passive smoke expo-
sure in adulthood (Table 2). At an expo-
sure level of more than 40 pack-years, life-
time nonsmokers showed a 30% increase
in risk wheth er the source of exposure was
all household members or spouses only.
Similarly, when the product of pack-years
and average number of hours expaised per
day was considered, lung cancer risk for
lifetime nonsmokers was elevated for the
highest exposure quartile whether the
source was all household members
(OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0,1.8) or spouses
only (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 3.7).
Among lifetime nonsmokers, a positive in-
creasing trend in risk was noted for pack-
years (P = .06). Passive smoking—related
risk estimates for adulthood exposures
were slightly lower for all subjects (i.e.,
both ex-smokers and lifetime nonsmok-
ers) than for lifetime nonsmokers alone,
although the same general elevations in
risk were noted. When analyses were
lim-
ited to direct interviews, no clear pattern
of increase or decrease in risk esfstiates
was apparent. Recording less quantitative
exposure variables, elevated risk was
shown for all subjects (OR = 1.7; 95%
CI ee 3.1, 2.6) at Are/1)0W/

In general, there was no elevated lung
canter risk associated with passive smoke
exposure in the workplace (not shown in
table). Only lifetime nonsmokers showed
a slight increase in risk at the highest quer -
tile of workplace exposure (OR = 1.2;
95% CI = 0.9, 1.7).
Among the 483 lung cancers that were
verified histolotcally, the predominant cell
types were adenocanonoma (62.4%), other/
mixed cell types (25.2%), squamous cell car-
cinoma (5.894, bronchioalveoier CarCinoma
(4.1%), and small cell carcinoma (23%).
The other/mixed cell type category con-
sisted mainly of large cell lung cancers,
though these lacked sufficient pathologic
evidence for precise classification. Table 3
presents results of cell type-specific analy-
ses for adulthood exposures. Elevated risk
was shown for othertixed cell types at
more than 40 pack-years of exposure
(OR = 1.6; 95% Q = L0,23). Although it
was based on small numbers, a risk estimate
of 1.7 was observed for small cell carcinoma
at the highest level of exposure.
We also examined risk among
women who had been exposed to passive
smoke in both childhood and adulthood.
in childhood but not in adulthood, and in
adulthood but nor in childhood. There was
no evidence of interaction between expo-
sure during the two periods.

Discussion
Our study suggests that exposure to
high levels of environmental tobacco
smoke in adulthood increases the risk of
lung cancer in nonsmokers. Exposure of
more than 40 pack-years' duration in-
creased the risk of lung cancer among non-
smokers by approximately 30%. This re-
lationsinp was consistently demonstrated
among lifetime nonsmokers whether the
exposure variable was pack-years or the
time-weighted product of pack-years and
average numbe r Of hours exposed per day.
Ourfindines are similar CO those of another
large study of Lung cancer in nonsmoking
women20 that identified an OR of approx-
imately 1.3 due to exposure to greater than
40 pack-years of spousal smoking.
In earlier studies, the most com-
monly reported index of passive smoking
exposure has been the presence or ab-
sence of a smoking spouse. In our data set,
no elevated risk was noted for this vari-
able. Since our study was limited to
women, part of the difference between our
findings and those of earlier studies may
be due to differences in the effects of pas-
sive smoke exposure by gender. The Na-
tional Research Council's summary of 13
studies2, found overall relatrve risks of
lung cancer in nonsmokers due to spousal
smoking of 1.32 for women and L62 for
men (although the esnmate for men was
based on few cases). It is possible that
men are exposed to other factors (e.g.,
occupational exposures) that may interact
with passive smoke exposure to increase
risk above that observed in women. Pres-
ence or absence of a smoking spouse is a
relatively crude measure of passive smoke
exposure, with a potential for wide vari-
abairy in actual exposure. It was noted in
one survey, for example, that 47% of
women mamed to smokers reported zero
hours of passive smoke exposure at
home.32 It has also been shown that con-
sidering spousal exposure alone may un-
derestimate total household passive
smoke exposure.' Another factor that
may account for the differences in lung
cancer risk due to spousal smoking be-
tween our study and earlier srudies may be
time trends in smoking patterns. The de-
clining prevalence of smoking among
men 39 has probably resulted in decreasing
years and perhaps levels of exposure To
passive smoke in the home among non-
smoking women whose husbands smoke.
Contrary to the findings of two earlier
case-control studres,7•26 our data showed
no evidence of excess lung cancer risk due
to passive smoke exposure in childhood.
The risk of lung cancer due to childhood
passive smoking may have some analogy
to risk among ex-smokers. After 10 years
of absrinence, the lung cancer risk for ex-
smokers declines to 36% to 30% of The risk
for continutng smokers.'o Similarly, lung
cancer risk due to passive smoke expo-
sure in childhood may decline by adult-
hood, especially in the absence of adult-

Passi,e bincitang and Lung Cancer
tiod passive smoking and lung cancer
have been conducted, and further re-
search in this area is needed.
Our analyses by histologic type
showed the largest increase in risk for
other/mixed cell types and, although the
estimate was based on very small numbers,
for small cell carcinoma. Previous studies
are inconsistent and often lacking in sample
size when evaluating risk by cell type.
Garfinkel et al_10 found an elev-ated risk for
squamous cell carcinoma and for other/
mixed cell types. Others"3 have observed
larger elevations for squamous and small
cell carcinoma than for adeno=trcinoma.
In contrast, Wu et alai and Fontham et
at?' found Sarin increases for adcoocarci-
norna. AnagdoriOnal diffiailty in evaluatina
prevsous studies of passive smoking and
lung cancer by histologic type is that few
studies have conducted systematic pathol-
ogy reviews to verify cell type.
Our study has several major strengths.
These include the large sample size-one of
the largest series of nonsmoking lung cancer
cases to date. In addition, we had relatively
high response rates from both case patients
and control subjects. Finally, we conducted
a pathology review of cases.
The main limitation of our study is
the possibility of recall bias for passive
smoke exposure variables. The less quan-
titative measures of passive exposure
(i.e., light, moderate, or heavy exposure)
resulted in larger risk estimates than more
quantitative estimates such as pack-years.
Because there is no way to confirm pre-
vious passive smoke exposure, it is diffi-
cult to determine the best index for can-
mating exposure. However, we found that
lung cancer risk due to adulthood passive
smoke exposure was elevated at the high-
est quartile of exposure whether we used
a more quantitative (e.g., pack-years) or
less quantitative (e.g., heavy exposure)
variable.
Another possible source of bias in our
study is the large number of surrogate in-
terviews for cases. Earlier Studies,'
however, have shown relatively close
agreement on most passive smoke expo-
sure vatiables as reported by subjects and
spouses. We found fairly minor alterations
in risk estimates when analyses were re-
stricted to directly interviewed cases- In
addition, we compared socicdemoirraphic
characteristics of direct and surrogate
case-group interviews and found close
agreement for most variables. As one
might expect, the exception was age; there
was a tendency toward mote youngercase
patients in direct interviews.
November 1992, Vol. 82, No. 11
in summary, our study and others
conducted during the past decade suggest
a small but consistent elevation in the risk
of lung cancer in nonsmokers due to pas-
sive smoking. The proliferation of federal,
state. and local regulations that restrict
smolung in public places and work sites."'

0.9, and that further adjustment for assumed radon daughter exposure
gave very similar estimates.
There are a number of reasons why it was decided not to use data from
this study in the more detailed assessment of the results for lung cancer
given in Chapter 3:
(i) The study was designed to investigate possible effects of radon and not
ETS and, as such, the controls, which contained many with smoking-
related diseases, were not appropriate.
(ii) It is not Slated whether the ETS findings were based on never smokers,
non-smokers or the whole population.
(iii) Results are not given for males and females separately.
(iv) Numbers of ETS exposed and unexposed cases and controls are not
given.
2.4.3 Colorado Case-Control Study of Adenocareinomo Brownson
Using the Colorado Central Cancer Registry, Brownson et at. [58] identified
149 microscopically confirmed cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung and
169 age- and sex-matched controls with cancers of the colon or bone mar-
row diagnosed during 1979-82. Interviews were carried out with 102 cases
(68%) and 131 controls (78%), in which information on smoking, ETS,
occupation, social status, and exposure to air pollution was collected. Four
male and 19 female cases reported never having smoked. Risk of adenocar-
cinoma was estimated to be .68 times higher among female never smokers
who reported ETS exposure for 4 or more hours per day than among those
who reported exposure for up to 3 hours per day. This relative risk, which
was adjusted for age, income and occupation, was not statistically signifi-
cant (95% confidence limits, 0.39-2.97). Data were collected on smoking
by the spouse, bUt results were not reported for never smokers.
While the study has the advantages that it concerns a single histologi-
cal type, microscopic confirmation has been obtained for all cases, and it
has an appropriate control group, it is severely limited by the small num-
ber of non-smokers studied. The high non-response rate is also a problem,
as is the fact that a higher proportion of interviews for the case group
(69%) than for the control group (39%) were completed by a relative or
friend.
2.4.4 Texas Case-Control Study of Lung Cancer - Buffler
Buffier et at. [59] identified 1,520 histologically confirmed lung cancer
cases over the period 1976-80 in 56 hospitals in Texas, and carried out

In the study by  Kabat and Wypder i561, lung
cancer patients in six cities were identified, and
controls were matched to the cases on age, sex.
race, date of interview and hospital. More care
seems to have been takcn in this study than in
the others to ensure that subjects classified as
non-smokers were truly such. Interviewers used
a standardized questionnaire, but it is unclear
whether they were blinded to the status of the
patient as a case or a control.
The study of Beier et al. ($71 was conducted
in six coastarcounties in Texas. Little infor-
rnation is provided about such key features of
the study as the criteria for classifying the
spouse as a "regular smoker" or not, whether
ex-smokers were included or excluded, whether
the interviewers were blinded, and the number
or patients for whom a surrogate interviewer
was required.
Garfinkel et 64.1581  studied cases and controls
from hospitals in New Jersey and Ohio. Con-
trols were patients with colorectal cancer,
matched to the cases on age and hospital. The
interviewers were kcpt blinded to the status of
each patient. Women were counted as unex-
posed to ETS even if their husbands smoked
cigarettes only occasionally." There was exten-
sive reliance on surrogate interviewees, many
with questionable knowledge about the patient:
approximately one quarter of all interviews were
with someone other than the patient, the spouse
or a child, about 60% were with the spouse or
a child, and only 12% were with the patient
herself.
The case-control study by Wu et al. [591,
conducted in Los Angeles County, was the
first to use neighborhood rather than hospital-
ized controls. Only eases who were still alive
were interviewed (all on the telephone); i.e. no

surrogates were permitted for cases who had
died or who refused to be interviewed. No
information was provided as to whether the
interviewers were blinded. The point estimate or
the OR given by the authors in their paper's
abstract and in the text on p. 748, OR = 1.2. is
inconsistent with the confidence interval re-
ported in both of those places, 0.5-3.3 (the
geometric mean of the limits roust equal the
point estimate). Instead of working with these
incorrect values, we used in Table 2 and in Fig.
2 of this paper the values for "spouse smoked"
for adenocarcinoma in their Table 2: OR = 1.2,
with a 95% confidence interval extending from
0.6 to 2.5.

row and were matched according to age and sex
(there was approximately a 50:50 split on sex
for the patients with lung cancer). The inter-
viewer was blinded to the case or control status
of the patient. The interviewee was someone
other than the patient (mainly the spouse but
occasionally a sibling or child) for nearly 70%
of the cases and almost 40% of the controls.

munication from the senior author).

INTRODUCTION
AS part of a ease-control investigation of lung cancer among
atomic bomb survivors conducted primarily to evaluate the
interactive roles Of cigarette smoking and ionizing radiation
(1), data were collected on the smoking habits Of the subject's
spouses and parents. Herein we report the effect of exposure so
Such passive smoking, focusing on married women who had
never smoked themselves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Since 1951 a cohort of 110.000 Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bomb survivors has been followed by the RERF,' formerly called the
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (2). During the period 1971 to
1980. 525 newly diagnosed cases of primary lung Cancer (Eighth
Revision 1CD 162.1) were identified among cohort members. The cases
were ascertained from the Hiroshima and Nagssski Tumor and Tissue
Registries. the RERF mortality, surgical, and autopsy hies, and Hiro-
shima University medical weeds. The diagnosis was based on biopsy
or surgical pathotogy findings for 25%, on autopss findings for 28%.
on cytology foe 4%, and oat eadrotenicaL/clustat findings for the re-
maining 43%. Since the cohort repsesents a fixed populstion that is
aging over time and is older than the general population, the ages at
diagnosis were higher than uspal for lung cancer in Japarr the means
were 72.1 for males and 70.2 los females; the ranges were 36 to 94 for
males and 35 to 95 for females.
Controls were selected from among cotton members without brag

The controls were Maitvidaalty matched to the cases with mixes so yr

the cues had died, 111011 of the controls were also deceased. The
deceased controls were chosen wording to the above-mentioned
matching critelia, plus year of death (± 3 ye). and they were selected
from among all causes of death except cancer and chronic respiratory
disease. The distribution of the controls series is as follows- Alive. 13%;

Interviews were sesight during 1912 with all eases and controls, or
their next of kin. who lived is Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The interview
ers were swift that the study concerned lung cancer. but they were noi
told of the care-control slaws of, she study subjects. A Structured
questionnaire was used to obtain histories of cigarette smoking and
demographic, medical, occupational, and other factors. lithe individual
was married, inquiry was made about the smoking status of the spouse,
including the avenge number of cigarettes smoked per day, age started
smoking, and, for those who stopped, the age of cessation of smoking
Using this information, together with the numbers of ye the husband
arid wife lived together, an index of exposure to the spouse's smoking
was calculated In addition, a single question was asked regarding
whether the subject's mother and/or father smoked when the subject
was living at home as s child
OR were calculated as measures of the association between lung
cancer and passive smoking and other factors (3). Estimates of the OIL
and corresponding significance tests, were obtained by a conditional
logistic regression ar.alysis for matched data (4). Tests for trend used
consecutive inners for levels of the ordered categories Because there
were a pew( hypotheses that passive smoking might increase lung
cancer tisk., all significance tests for passive smoking effects were unc-
urled. with 90% CI used for interval estimates of the OR. Because
interest focused on spouse smoking patterns, eliminated from the
analyses were the one eine and 6 controls among males and the 4 casts
and 7 controls among females who were never married. Among the
married individusls. almost all had been married to only one spouse.
Among those with more than one spouse, information was avadable
only for the most recent. Also excluded from each table were individuals
with missing data for the variable king studied
RESULTS
Interviews were obtained for 428 cases and 957 controls.
respectively, 81% and 82% of the eligible cases and controls.
The two primary reasons for nonresporise were the refusal of
next of kin to answer questions about their deceased relatives
and the decision not to attempt to locate next of kin for subjects
who had moved out of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. The dtstribution
of informants is given in Table 1, indicating that the informa-
tion for most of the subjects was provided by next of kin. The
type of respondent. however, was similar for cases and controls.
Table 2 shows the lung cancer OR according 10 the Smoking
status (smoker versus never smoked) of the subjects and their
spouses. In both sexes there was an increased lung cancer risk
associated with direct smoking. As indicated, almost all (93%)
of the male lung cancer cases were smokers, but only a minority
(38%) of the women with lung cancer in this population were
reported to have ever smoked. Although not shown, the OR
increased with the numbers of cigarettes usually smoked per
day during adulthood for both men and women. Among males
who smoked 1 to 9. 10 to 19, 20 to 29, and 30+ cigarettes per
day, the OR were 1.7, 1.8, 3.4, and 9.7, respectively (P for trend
<0.01). Among females who smoked 1 to 9. 10 to 19. and 20+
cigarettes per day, the OR were 1.9, 2.0, and 4.9 (P for trend <
0.01). Table 2 shows that among female nonsmokers married
to smokers, there was an elevated risk for lung cancer (OR w
1.5; 90% Cl w 1.0 to 2.5; P w 0.07). Although similar increases
associated with smoking habits of spouses were observed for
female smokers and for male nonsmokers and smokers, sufli-

dent data for detailed analyses of passive smoking patterns
were available only for female nonsmokers.
The data for nonsmoking women are categorized in Table 3
according to the number of cigarettes the husband usually
smoked per day during adulthood. There was an itemising
lung cancer risk with increasing amount smoked per day by the
husband, with the OR slightly exceeding 2-fold for women
whose husbands were heavy smokers. No os000ione trend of
increasing risk associated with increasing duration of exposure
to husband's smoking was found (Table 1). Risks according to
time of exposure are examined in Table 5. The odds ratios were
lower among "ex-passive smokers" than among women who
had been exposed to their husbands' smoking within the past
10 yr. The reduction in risk with cessation ofexposure remained
after adjusting for the amount of cigarettes smoked per day by
the spouse.

As shown in Table 6, the risk oflung cancer tended to increase
in relation to exposure to the husband's tobacco smoke for each
of housewives, white collar, and blue collar workers. The highest
odds ratio occurred for women who had blue collar jobs and
were mimed to men who smoked one or more packs of ciga-
rettes per day, but the numbers involved were
The odds ratios from the matched logistic regression analyses
presented in Tables 2 to 6 are generally similar to unadjusted
odds ratios that can be calculated from the cross-products of
the numbers of exposed and unexposed cases and controls,
indicating that confounding in unadjusted analyses by age, city,
vital status, and yr of death (the matching factors) is not
substantial. We also assessed whether the associations with
passive smoking were consistent across the various strata de-
fined by the matching factors. The numbers of subjects in
several of the categories became quite small with this fine a
cross-classification, but the trends with husbands' smoking
tended to be seen throughout, with no strong differences by age
group or by city of residence. The trends were also apparent for
each type of informant (self, husband, child, and other); in
particular the elevated risk for heavy relative to nonexposure
to husbands' smoking was detected when data were reported by
the husbands or subjects themselves. Radiation exposure was
also examined as I potential confounder and effect modifier.
No significant influence of radiation dose on the passive smok-
ing association was detected, although the trends with passive
smoking seemed stronger among the unexposed.
Information on the histological types of lung cancer was
unavailable for 43% of the eases who were diagnosed only on
radiological or clinical evidence. We conducted separate anal-
yses among those with and without a pathological confirmation
of lung cancer and found increased risks associated with passive
smoking for both groups The OR among nonsmoking women

married to smokers was 1,4 for the cases and their matched
controls with a histologically confirmed diagnosis. and 1.6 for
those wr,h a clinical/radiological diagnosis. Among women
with a histological diagnosis, adenocarcinorna was the predom-
inant cell type, but the distribution of histological types varied
by smoking status (Table 7). The percentage of squamous and
small cell carcinoma was much higher among smokers than
nonsmokers. Although based on small numbers. there were also
more squamous and small cell cancers among nonsmoking
females whose husbands smoked.
Responses to die question on parental smoking while the
subject was a child were movided for only two-thirds of the
Subjects. Among these the mothers of the subjects were reported
to be smokers for 13% of the cases and 17% of the controls,
and the fathers, for 67% of the cases and 66% of the controls.
Hence there was no overall increased risk associated with
parental smoking, nor was these any significant increase after
stratifying by smoking status of the subject. Among male smok-
ers, the OR for lung cancer associated with maternal smoking
was 1.1.
DISCUSSION
The results from this ease-control study suggest that there
may be a moderate excess in lung cancer risk associated with
passim smoking. The odds ratios for lung cancer among non-
smoking women tended to increase with amount smoked by
their husbands, a trend seen among housewives as welt as
women who worked outside the home. The highest odds ratios
among nonsmokers were for women who worked in blue collar
jobs whose husbands were heavy smokers, women presumably
with the highest exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
There was little association with parental smoking or with ex-
passive' smoking, suggesting that cessation of exposure may
lower risk.
The fuidings are generally consisten t with results of a national
cohort study of monality among Japanese women (5) and of
several epidemiological investigations conducted elsewhere in
the world (6-8). Updated follow-up for the peeled 1966 to 1981
of the study conducted among an adult population selected
from multiple areas throughout Japan, excluding Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, showed telladient in mortality with amount
smoked by the husband (9). The increase in risk reached 90%
among those whose husbands smoked 20 or more cigarettes per
day, a figure in line with the 2-fold excess for 30 or more
cigarettes per day of smokers in our study. The similarity in
results, despite different methodological approaches, suggests
that the association between lung cancer and passive smoking
is not an artifact of recall bias which can affect retrospective
studies. Furthermore, we were unable to identify any strong
confounding factors, including radiation exposure, that may
have accounted for the passive smoking assoriation.
It is noteworthy that a recent survey in Esoto. Japan, found
significantly elevated levels of cotinine, the major metabolite of
nicotine, in the early morning urine of nonsmokers who lived
in households with smokers or worked in offices/factories with

smokers (10). The cotinine concentrations among nonsmoker
living with 2-pack-a-day smokers were roughly equivalent a
the cotinine levels of smokers of less than 3 cigarettes per day
Precise estimates of the lung cancer risk associated with thi.
level of smoking are not available, since not many smoke s(
few cigarettes per day. However, 3 well-known prospectiv,
studies of mortality among smokers (the American Canes
Society study involving nearly 1 million volunteers (11), the 16
yr follow-up of 250,000 United States veterans (12), and th
20-yr follow-up of 34,000 British doctors (13)) found relatis,
risks of lung cancer of 4.6, 4.8, and 7.8 among I to 9, 1 to 9
and I to 14 cigarette-per-day smokers. respectively. Linea
interpolation between these values and the base-line level of t.r
for nonsmokers would yield estimated relative risks for 1 so:
cigarette-per-day smokers of nearly 2-fold, about the same orde
of increase observed for "heavy" passive smokers in this study
Hence, if the Kyoto results (10) are applicable elsewhere,' an,
if urinary cotinine levels reflect levels of exposure to the carcir
ogenic substances in tobacco smoke, then the observed magn:
tude of the increased lung cancer risk among passive smoker
in Japan seems not greatly out of line with what might b
expected based on their exposure to environmental tobacci
smoke.
It should be noted that the risk ratios for lung cancer assc
dated with direct smoking (as shown in Table 2) were lower i;
this case-control study than typically found in case-control an.
cohort investigations in other countries (14). The lower 01
among smokers in part arises from our selection, in order t,
minimize respondent bias, of controls matched to cases on sits
status, which led to the inclusion of some controls who died c
smoking-related diseases. However, lung cancer risk rat IDS geT
era/l) similar to those in this study were also reported in th
prospective study of Japanese adults (9). Because of the lowc
relative risks of lung cancer among smokers in Japan, differ
ences in the OR between direct and passive smokers are not a
high as.in western countries. Indeed, we found OR for 'titan
passive smokers to be nearly equal those for women who wee
reported to be light smokers themselves. While such similarit
was unexpected. characteristics such as the size and style c
residential units might result in a higher environmental-tc
direct tobacco smoke exposure ratio in Japan (and thus less c
a difference in OR for lung cancer between passive and direr
smokers). This in fact is suggested by the comparison of th
cotinine analyses between Japan and Great Britain (10, 15
where the ratio of cotinine levels in passive compared to diem
smokers was considerably higher in Japan. Our finding 6,-,
lung cancer risk among nonsmokers may be less closely relate
to duration of exposure to tobacco smoke, the major deterrn
nant of lung cancer risk among smokers (I3), than to intensit
and recency of exposure also may be noteworthy. Such a diffr:
enre might contribute to a higher ratio in Japan of lung caner
risks in passive compared to direct smokers. since the cutter
prevalence of smoking is higher in Japan than in either Gre:.
Britain or the United Stales, but the marked temporal increac
in smoking began Later (9. 16).
The present study did riot replicate the finding of a cast
control study in Louisiana which showed a higher risk anion
male smokers whose mothers had smoked (7). Although we di
find higher percentages of smokers among both cases an
controls and among both men and women whose parents ha
been smokers, there was no elevation in the OR among smokin

however, since many et the cases and controls had provided
information on their smoking habits in routine RERF surveys
conducted in the 1960s when all study subjects were alive (I.
2). The data in Table 8 indicate very high concordance in the
identification of a female As A nonsmoker or smoker by s next
of kin in 1982 and by the woman herself in the 1960s. In
addition to providing some confidence that the data provided
by surrogates are adequate, the confirmation of nonsmoking
ftRILS by a nest of km argues against the possibility that
Japanese women tend to report themselve-s as nonsmokers when
they actually smoke. The 1982 survey revealed a higher per-
centage of male smokers than reporte-d earlier, rut the increase

Questions about the smoking habits of spouses were not asked
in the surveys in the 1960s. so that serf versus surrogate report-
ing on this variable cannot be assessed directly let our study.
however. there were DO significant differences in the passive
smoking rrends according to respondent type. In particular, an
increased OR was seen for nonsmoking women whose husbands
were heavy smokers when the data were reported by the hus-
bands themselves.
Another concern in this case-control study was the reliability
of the diagnoses of ban Cant:LT . Forty-three % the case-4 were
diagnosed solely on clinical and/or radiological evidence. The
percentage was high in Uric part because the cobort being
followed was elderly, and surgical or biopsy procedures were
less likely to be performed On older patients. The OR associated
with Passive smoking, however, were similar when calculations
were rrstricted to bisrologic-ally confirmed cases. We also cal-
culated OR after deleting 23 cases and their matched controls

nude only on radiological grounds and who had survived 5 or
more y-r (all were in fact living as of January 1984), since the

of lung cancer, but its effect is s:eater for squamous and small
cell carcinoma 1111.111 adencicarcthorna (17), Whether passive
smoking might have the same predilection for squatuous can-
cers is not clear, but ow- limited histological data (Table 7) are
consistent with this notion. it is of interest that the highest OR
for passive smoking has been reported from s case-c-ontrol study
in Greece (6, 18. 19) where the cases were limited to lung
cancers other than adenocartinoma.
In summary, the results of this investigation suggest that
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke may increase the
risk of lung cancer among nonsmokers. The findings, from one
of the two areas of the world where the possibility of a passive
smoking bawd was first postulated, add to an accumulating
body of evidence on the issue. While the total evidence is not
delinirive and not all studies show lig-Dino:a:lay positive asso-
ciations 12(-22). the results are suggestive enough to warrant
further evaluation in larger studies where passive smoking
exposures can be more fully quantified.

2.4.1 Japanese Atomic Bomb Survivors Study of Lung Cancer — Akiba
From a cohort of 110,000 Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors
followed since 1951, Akiba et al. 156] identified 525 cases of primary lung
cancer diagnosed during 1971-80 and 1,167 controls matched on sex, year
of birth, city of residence, vital status, and whether they were participating
in a programme of biennial medical examinations.
Interviews were sought during 1982 with all cases and controls or their
next of kin who lived in the two cities, with questionnaires completed by
428 cases and 957 controls. Information was obtained on cigarette smok-
ing history, smoking by the spouse, and also demographic, medical, occu-
pational and other factors.
Table 2.19 shows the estimated relative risk of lung cancer according
to spouse smoking for. those individuals who reported never having
smoked cigarettes. The elevated risk of lung cancer in women whose hus-
bands smoked was almost significant (p = 0.07). There was also evidence of
an increasing trend in risk according to husband's daily consumption of
cigarettes (p = 0.06) and to recency of exposure to husband's smoking (p
0.05), but not according to the husband's duration of smoking while mar-
ried. No association was seen between lung cancer risk and smoking by
parents.
The study had a number of limitations that should be noted:
(i) Information was obtained from only about 80% of the cases and con-
trols, leading to the possibility of bias if those who responded differed
from those who did not.
(ii) The controls included a substantial number of patients who had died
from smoking-related diseases, including 13% from coronary heart
disease and 26% from stroke.
(iii) Only 53% of lung cancer cases were based on biopsy or on surgical
pathology or autopsy findings, with 4% of diagnoses based on cytology
and 43% on radiological or clinical findings. The problem of conse-
quent unreliability of diagnosis was only partially answered by the
authors, who noted that the results were little changed if analysis
excluded those 23 calm (and their matched controls) for whom a diag-
nosis was based on radiOlogical grounds alone and who had survived 5
or more years.
(iv) Information was obtained from the subjects themselves for only 10%
of cases and 12% of controls. For 55% of cases and 53% of controls,

information could not be obtained even from the spouse, and was
supplied by a child, daughter-in-law or another informant A conse-
quence. of this was seen when subject smoking status as recorded in
1982 was compared with that recorded in 1964-68. For men, as many
as 50% of those reported not to be smokers in 19M-68 were reported
to be smokers in 1982. Akiba et al, note that this increase may reflect
an actual increase in smoking prevalence over time_ This seems
implausible, however, as the average age of She cases and controls
would have been about 60 in 1964-68 arid the decision to take up
smoking typically occurs at a much younger age While the concor-
dance between 1964-68 and 1982 smoking habit data is much better
for women, doubts about the accuracy of the smoking habit classifica-
tion must remain_
2A.2 Southern Swedish Study of Lung Canter - Axeison
Axelscm et at. (51 describe results from a case-control study of radon
exposure carried out in the central part of southern Sweden in an area with
alum shale deposits. The study involved [77 men and women who had
died from lung cancer aged 30-84 in 1960-81 and 673 controls who had
died from other diseases. Each case and control had to have lived in the
same building for at least 30 years. Radon exposure was assessed visually
for all subjects, and by measurement in a subsample of 142 cases and 264
controls. information on smoking and ETS exposure was obtained from
next of kin for 152 cases and 457 controls. The study reported relative risks
of 1.0, 1.4 and 1.7 for three increasing categories of radon exposure (trend
p - 0.006), although the pattern was not entirely consistent in uh divisio ris
of the data by smoking habits and by urban/rural status. The concern of the
study was with radon exposure, and the authors merely noted that the
overall crude lung cancer rate ratio was 1.2 for exposure to ETS, that
adjustment for age, sex and urban/rural status reduced the relative risk to

In Hong Xong, lung oancer is the commonest Lethal
malignant disease in both males and females. This thesis
represented the first major clinical study of lung canoer (1979-
1914) in the local Chinese population.
The patient* were those admitted to the University
Department of Vedicine, Queen Wary Hospital, Hong Zoog, and all

Of patients was small.
The next phase is collection of clinical dat& base by
clinical review of 493 patients admitted from 1976 to 1990.
The male to tfiAls rex ratio was low (1.97:1). reflecting the
5664054S6

high incidence of lung cancer in women in Hong Kong. ln men, 8Q
was the predominant cell type (44%), followed by AD (235), BM
(135) and LA (75), but in some:, the preponderance of AD (445;
BQ 31%; 611 10%; LA 25) Is noteworthy. Cigarette smoking wail a
major factor in 5Q and BS. The relative risk of lung cancer in
smokers was 8.4 to 10.7 or BQ and eV, but was not significant
with AD or LA (< SQ and BM, being. smoking-related. shoved
features of a centrally located tumour. Our AD, contrary to
classical teaching, also showed clinical, radiological and
bronchoscopic feature, of a centrally situated tumour.
A tbres-Part study was then carried out in parallel from
1051 to 1984 : -

data were collsotod from 503 patients Upon
' 'diagnosis from January 1081 to April 1984. The findings of the
etudy were confirmed. The male to femalt.ratiobwus low.:
histOry of cigarette smoking vas strongly
associated with 8Q and BK. The relative risk of lung canoer in
Smokers was 3.5 with SQ and 21 with Sid in men, and 10.5 with SQ
Lea 53.9 with $U in woosn, but not excessive with AD and LA (1
to 2.1). in women, AD was tbe predominant cell type (56%), and
48% of all cases and 83% of AD were life-long non-smoker.
Again. AD showed features of a predominantly centrally situated

0 appears in sidestreim smoke (Winters & DiFranna, 1283).
In addition, the exposure of the passive smoker to naturally
Ooourring radon daughtere is locreLeod In a smoky environment.
It wts estimated that radon daughter.ozposurs could account tor
20 to 100 per cent of lung Cancers seen in non-smokers (ilarley L
Pasternack, 1981; Winters & Dirrenza, 1963). 2ba conflicting
findings of the Japacess (Rirayama, 1981) and American
(Garfinkle, 1981) studies-might be due to differences ID
•methodology (Weisz at al, 1983). A potentially important factor
La that the American study lacked smoking data on 735 of the
". husbands of nonsmoking women in comparison to only 28% in the
Japaoesa study, which may have created biases in the data. A
•
• greater number of working women, larger home* and a higher
• divorce rate in the ['cited 3tatas a.re ether factors that could
serve tO'account tor the differeoces in results between these
studies. ID HOtf tong, the problem of overcrowding is
notorious, with many families living in houses/flats of area 400
to 800 square feet Only, and this would increase the inhaled
dose of any potential inhaled careioogen present in home
environment. Previous OatiCALOS would have setimated the
attributable risk of lung cancer due to passive smoking to be
30% greater it non-smokeu exposed regularly to passive smoke

compared «o nonsmokers not expoeled (Leeds, 1978). It has been
found that both the Japaneee and the Amerioan studies were it
1
tact consisteot with suoh Ln street (Tel.'s, 1083).
The apparent association between passive smoking and
peripheral adanocarcinoma and cot central tumouraj in our
patients is unexpected, and the reason unclear. It is known
however that there is a difference in chemical composition ot
msinstrotm and sidestream smoke (Stock, 1990; Correa st al,
1993; Toles et al 1983). Mainstream smoke emerge' into the
environment after having been drawn through the cigarette,
filtered by the smoker's own lungs, sad then exhaled.
Videstream smoke arises from the burning end of the cigarette
-•
-and enters directly into the envirotmctt. these lead to
•marked,differezoos.in.the concentration ot the constituents of
• ziainetream aad stdestrotm smoke, and mazy potentially tOSio gib
•
phase constituents,'inoluding titrosamins, are iz higher

nearly 8SS of smoke in room results from sidestream smoke (Weise
et al, 1983). /t is true, of course, that sidestream smoke La
getorslI7 diluted in aconsiderably larger volume. Thus,
Passive smokers are ezposed to a quantitatively smaller in
qualitatively different smoke expolure than active smokers.

peripheral location remains, it present, conjectural.
Two or the limitations of the prestat study aro the
relatively small number of subjects studied. And the inclusion
of only one hospital, albeit a large, regional geaeral hospital.
Large, city-wid• multi-hcepital studies are warranted, and we
are currently overcoming the immense logistic problems aad
pursuing further collaborative studies is this area (vide
infra).
7.5. Conclusion
1.
Our results Showed that kerosene stove fumes tad home
.::1..incsnes burning are not contributory factors for
•aderlocarcinome of lung, whether ceatral. or peripheral.
Passive smoking is also not shown to be aesociated with
•
adenocarCinoma of the central type.' The reason for the
,prepooderanee of central adetocarcinoma in cur no:-
smoker Ismale patient population has therefore remained
unanswered.
2. ?nor+, is however.suggestion of passive smOkiel
associated with peripheral edenocaroinoma, pertioularlY
passive smoking due to smoking husbands. The reason
tor the periPheral location of the associated tumour is
56G405505

not cloar, although It is known that smokers ars
espossd to a qualitatively diffsromt amok, am oomparod
to aetivor smokers.
3. These findings mood to be cCnfirmod by lirge, city-side,
multi-institutional studies.

Oat* 13.05.1992
am attaching 12 pages (only first page of Annex IA) for your possible discussions in Naples.
will bring a full copy to Richard Ford next week so that he can determine if any GRAS
Substances have been omitted.
Basically, it is the intent of the Commission In drafting this text that:
(I) all GRAS substances are automatically permitted (these make up the major part of the
4500 substances in Annex IA) (Art 2,21.
(ii) all non-GRAS substances currently In use in Europe (about 450 which industry has until
June 1, to divutge to the Commission) will constitute Annex 18. These will also be initially
permitted ( Art. 2.21 but by January 1, 1997 (unless postponed) they will have to be moved
into Annex IA (An. 31 or be no longer permitted (Art. 41.
(lit) new substances can be added to Annex IA (Art 31 but no confidentiality is accorded nor
iS there any guarantee of rapid and uncomplicated acceptance.
(iv) substances can for health reasons be totally removed from Annex IA (le banned) [Art 31 or
subject to special conditions of use (le limited) (An 61.
(v) the Commission will have ultimate power in dictating all of these movements of sub-
stances from and off tha different parts of Annex I. The Standing Committee for Food will
have a (limited) say and the Scientific Committee for Food will have its opinion followed as
uSual. This latter Committee will be a special working group composed of :
Prof. KnOdsen (Denmark) •
Dr. Gry {Denmarka '
Dr. Griinow (Germany) *
Dr. Delcourt (Belgium) '
Dr. Salvatore (Italy)
A French delegate to be named
*Consultants :
(" Council of Europe stalwarts)
Prof. Elias "
P. Cadby
There will still be a review by this committee of data used to accord GRAS status.
The Commission has asked the FDA for copies of SLI9.8 and we understand that the FDA has
promised to send only the FASPs (Food Additive Safety Profiles which we wanted to avoio).
Industry will probably have to complement this information (SIRs and Narrative Summaries).
EFEA is still not happy with this text and there Is still a tong way to go before It gets adopted.

Genera/ criteria for the use of flavouring substances:
1. Flavouring substances can be approved provided that they present no
risk to the health of the consumer,
2. To assess the possible harmful effects of a f out,(ng substance, it
must be subjected to appropriate toxicologica ,t.e‘ n. nd evaluation.
When a flavouring substance contains or cons s a genetically
modified organism as mentioned In Article 2. paragraphs 1 and 2 of the
Directive 90/220/EEC of the Council, Articles 11 to 18 of the
Directive 90/220/EEC will not be applicable. However, the evaluation
of the security of this flavouring substance Should take into account
the request for the security of the environment in Directive
90/220/EEC.
3. All flavouring substances must be kept under continuous observation
and must be reevaluated whenever necessary.

The Committee agreed that the "mini-monographs" should be called "narrative summaries,"
and reviewed several samples (Attachment 2). Dr. Ford agreed to formulate time and
financial estimates for completing this project. The Committee agreed that the FEMA
position should be that "narrative summaries" are appropriate for the SCF to use to confirm
safety and to establish regulatory status of flavor materials and that a rile novo review is
unnecessary. The Committee also agreed that this position should be clearly communicated
to the SCF and that FEMA should continue to work through FDA in its interactions with the
SCF. It was noted that there are 1100 sobstances in Annex 3 of the E.C. Flavor Directive,
and that it may be advisable to produce narrative summaries for these materials.

ATTACHMENT I
& S PHRASES
Dr. Lane evaluated R (risk) and S (safety) phrases prepared
by IFRA/EFFA, and compared them with the R&S phrases used by PFW-
Netherlands. The objective of the evaluation was to determine
the degree to which the IFRA/EFFA phrases were consistent with
industry practice.
A review of 46 sets of R&S phrases prepared by IFRA/EFFA and
the same 46 sets used by PFW-Netherlands revealed only six
differences (13%). Three of the differences involved
flammability warnings only, and not health warnings. Of the
other three, only one was of concern. The IFRA/EFFA Working
Group on Labeling is aware of the discrepancies and is
investigating them.
It can be concluded that the IFRA/EFFA R&S phrases are
substantially consistent with industry practice and that when
differences arise they are reevaluated.

ATTACAMENT 2 CONFIDENTIAL
ANALYSIS OF THE REQUESTS FOR FURTHER DATA ON SPECIFIC FLAVOURING SUBSTANCES
BY THE EXPERTS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE
If definitive approval of flavouring Substances under the proposed new EC regulations is to be conting-
ent in part on their classification in List A by the Experts of the Council of Europe. The following
examples may be of Interest.
These have been categorized Into those which on preliminary reading appear to be unjustified for the
following reasons.
A • EXISTING TOXICITY DATA WOULD SEEM TO BE ADEQUATE
1- 2-Acety1-2-thiazoline (CoE 2335, FEMA
TESTING REQUIRED : 28 day oral Study (30000 Ecus).
TESTING ALREADY CARRIED OUT: A 21 day, a 90 day and a 1 year oral study in rats. All of these
studies showed that the no-effect level was above 2 mg/kg/day.
ANTICIPATED MAXIMUM EXPOSURE : There Is no survey data on this material but it is unlikely that
more than 10 kg are used in the EEC/year. Daily per capita exposure is unlikely to exceed 10 rig/kg/day
(see Note 1).
SAFETY FACTOR: At least 500.000.
2- 2,4-Dimethy1-5-apetylthiazole (CoE 2336., FEMA 3267)
TESTING REQUIRED : 28 day oral study and mutagenictty studies.
TESTING ALREADY CARRIED OUT: 90 day oral study in rats; No-effect level more than 24.8 mg/kg/
day
ANTICIPATED MAXIMUM EXPOSURE : Amul 10 ppm in candy no Amul for drinks (see Note 2).
From PDG 87 (Note 3) daily per capita exposure is less than 1 ng/kg/day (Note 1).
SAFETY FACTOR : Above 25 million.
OTHER COMMENTS :Priority Ranking 1 (downgraded from 2 due to existing
toxicity data).
Estimated use In EEC : 1 kg/year.
Cost of testing : 40.000 Ecus.
3- 2-Thlenyi disulfide (CoE 2333, FEMA 3323)
TESTING REQUIRED : 28 day oral study and mutagenicity studies.
TESTING ALREADY CARRIED OUT : 90 day oral study in rats; No-effect level more than 0.3 mg/kg/
day.
ANTICIPATED MAXIMUM EXPOSURE : Amul 1.25 ppm in soft drinks. 2.33 ppm in confectionary
(Note 2). From POG 87 (Nate 3) daily per capita exposure is less than 1 rig/kg/day (Note 1).

Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Name:
BEN ZALDEHYDE, 4-ETHYL
Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Number:
474-8-78-1
Chemical Structure:
This aromatic aldehyde is used as a flavor ingredient at levels resulting in concentrations
ranging from 1-40 ppm in food with a total annual volume of less than 100 lbs/yr. This usage
results in a calculated per capita daily intake of less than 9 rig/leg. While slightly higher use
levels have been reported in chewing gum, this should not contribute significantly to the total
daily intake. The very low toxicity of this material is demonstrated by the very low oral LID„
of 2 g/kg in the rat.
While no repeated dose toxicity study has been conducted on this material, the very
closely related material tolualdetiyde (an equal molar mixture of 3 and 4-methylbenzaldehyde)
has been the subject of a 90-day rat oral study at levels of 50, 250 or 500 mg/kg for 13 weeks
The no-effect level was found to be 250 mg/kg/day for that substance. If it can be assumed
that p-ethylbenzaldehyde is no more than 10 times as toxic as tolualdehyde, a very conservative
estimate, a safety factor can be estimated as at least 3,000,000. This combined with the wide
natural occurrence of this material in various foods including chicken, cider and roasted
peanuts, leads to the conclusion that this material should pose no significant risk under the
conditions of use and could be concluded to be GRAS. This material can also be compared :o
the slightly less closely related benzaldehyde which has a very similar no-effect level in the at
according to studies conducted by the NT?.

ALPHA-IONOL (FEMA 3624)
Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Name:

Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Number:
25312-34-9
Chemical Structure:
OH
This alicyclic alcohol is used as a flavor ingredient in foods at levels ranging
from 0.07 to 3 ppm and was reported to be used in 1982 with a total annual volume of
0.3 kg/year. Again, it is noted that slightly higher use levels are reported in hard
candy and chewing gum but here the lower volatility results in these levels, i.e., 4 ppm
in hard candy and 5 ppm in chewing gum. The very low annual use of this material
converts into a per capita daily intake of 0.06 rig/kg. This level is so low that the
substance has no toxicological significance.
The very low acute toxicity of this material is demonstrated by the fact that the
LD50 is greater than 5 glkg (Moreno, 1980 tAttached]). The metabolic fate of this
material can readily be assumed to go through oxidation to the corresponding ketone
(ALPHA-IONONE FEMA 2594, CAS NO, 127-41-3).
0
Because of thisassumed oxidation pathway, it can be further argued that the toxicologIc
effects of this alcohol would not be significantly different than that for the parent
ketone. ALPHA-IONONE, the ketone, has been the subject of a 90-day study
conducted by BIBRA in which the material was administered in the diet of rats at In els
providing approximately 10 or 100 mg/kg/day for 90-days (unpublished report, 19831
The very slight and questionably significant effects seen at 100 mg/kg lead to the
conclusion that the no-effect level was 10 mg/kg. Using the per capita daily intake of
ALPHA-IONOL and the assumption of similar toxicity to ALPHA-1ONONE leads to a
calculation of a safe t factor of about 170,000,000.
566405:139

AT TAC liMENT 2
It can easily be concluded based on the very high safety factor calculation using
an assumption of metabolic fate and structure similarity along with the extimely low
level of use and the fact that the material is a normal component of food (CIVO, 1991)
leads easily to the conclusion that this material is GRAS under the conditions of use as
a flavor ingredienl.

Report of a Meeting on 16 April 1992 with
FDA, HPB and Ag Canada on Process Flavor Issues
introduetiort
Lawrence Lin of (FDA) called John Hallagan (FEMA) during the
week of 23 March 1992 to schedule a meeting on 16 April to
discuss process flavor issues. Dr. Lin stated that he wished to
reschedule a meeting that had been postponed; he also stated that
a representative of the Canadian Health Protection Branch (HPB)
would be invited. The meeting was subsequently confirmed for 16
April with participants from FDA, HPB, Agriculture Canada (Ag
Canada), FEMA, and the Flavor Manufacturers of Canada (FRAC).
Pre-Meeting at FEMA - 16 April 1992
Flavor industry representatives (FEMA and FMAC) met at FEMA
prior to the meeting with the regulators (See Appendix 1 for the
list of participants).
The group reviewed a draft preliminary report received that
morning from Dr. Gian Gross regarding his work with the
analytical method (Appendix 2). Dr. Gabler was able to elaborate
on certain aspects of the report with respect to techniques and
equipment. After further discussion, Dr. Manley stated that it
appears that Dr. Gross' data support the conclusion that it is
likely that there are insignificant amounts of heterocyclic
amines (HCAs) in typical process flavors.

23AW1992 1
56C4 05545

2
The group discussed the results of the second "round robin"
and concluded based on comments by Drs. Gross and Gubler, that
the results produced by FDA and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) have somewhat limited usefulness. After
further discussion, it was determined that it appears necessary
to repeat the round robin to assure that all parties are able to
perform the analysis. The group also concluded that the
participants should be expanded to include the Canadians and
others in industry. The group determined that a workshop should
be conducted for all participants prior to the initiation of the
next round robin so that all will have access to the best
information on how to perform the analysis.
Mr. Winbush reported that he has had extensive discussions
with FDA statisticians regarding sampling issues associated with
the proposed process flavor study. A copy of his most recent
comments (which were submitted to FDA) was distributed to the
group (Appendix 3).
Dr. Higley reported on developments at the National Center
for Food Safety and Technology (NCFST) and stated that they may
return to doing work on their original proposal to produce
"pseudo" process flavors at very high temperatures and then
perform Ames tests on the resulting material. After discussion
it was determined that NCFST should be invited to participate in
the new "round robin."

$eeting et PDA - 14 April 1.992
The list of participants is in Appendix 1, and the agenda is
in Appendix 4.
Dr. Manley provided the group with an overview of the
project and Dr. Knize provided additional information on LLNL
activities. The group discussed a variety of details relevant to
the analytical method and all agreed that it is essential for the
laboratories running the analysis to follow the Gross SOP,
including use of the specified equipment. The group also
discussed other analytical methods including LC/MS and GC/MS, and
concluded that the Gross method is best suited for analyzing
potential HCAs in process flavors.
The group discussed the model process flavor that was
used in the second round robin and agreed that it could be
simplified if the fat and onions were deleted. However, it was
noted that alterations may result in a flavor that is not truly
representative of the marketplace. The FEMA representatives
agreed to reevaluate the constituents of the model flavor for the
next round robin.
Dr. Jackson (HCFST) noted that she has attempted analyses of
commercially available process flavors using the Gross method.
It was noted that information on potential presence of HCAs
in process flavors is necessary so that if specifications were
ever proposed, they could be tied to methods to control HCA
generation during the production of process flavors.

23 Avil 1992
566405547

Dr. Manley noted that current data suggest that HCAs are not
present in process flavors in significant amounts and subsequent
studies will simply verify this tentative conclusion.
After further discussion the group agreed on the following
course of action.
1. Complete and review the final report on the second round
robin (Dr. Gross is producing the report).
2. Plan a new round robin with additional participants
including the Canadian regulators and others in industry.
3 Conduct a workshop prior to initiating the new round robin
to provide technical assistance to participants.
It was determined that these activities would be coordinated
by Mr. Hallagan (TEMA) and that Dr. Lin (FDA), Mr. Lauer (HPB),
and Dr. Lee (Ag Canada) would be the contacts for the regulatory
agencies.
Post-meeting tt FrmA - 16 April 1992
Industry representatives met at FEMA after the FDA meeting.
It was determined that the following groups should be
invited to participate in the new round robin: FDA (Washington),
FDA (NCFST), HPB, Ag Canada, LLNL, Nestec, Givaudan
(Switzerland), and IFF.
Mr. Hallagan will make arrangements for the round robin and
the workshop: it was determined that 7, 8 July 1992 are good
dates for the workshop which will be held at LLNL.

nesse receive inchickd the updateiwi the collaborative stixty. In hid, I was rgiber disappointed by the qualhy of the &as
provided by the two US laboratories and the IAA that Ciivtitit.lan was 110t on time with their results. The reriort, thcrerbee, Avery
shOrt and includm only the results prrsiutied by Nestee. Tt itlxiutc1 t made dear in the forthcoming discussion itutt this kind or
analytical work =mire.% adequai int.trumcniatioh.
Nevertheless, my personal opinion is that thc inetlio..1 Is ot4 yot sufficiently cOwerful to allow a blued screening of very low nglg
heterocyclic amine traces in various Prceem Ravouis.
LInforiunately twill not he able to attend the siccing scitolulcd al April 10 fora private reason. I trope you will keep the

Quantitative Determination of Mutagenic Heterocyclic
Aromatic Amines in Process Flavours
Update on the 1991/1992 Interlaboratory Comparison initiated by the US Flavour and
Extract Manufacturers' Association as completed on April 18, 1992
Glen A Gross
Nested Ltd Research Centre,
VerS-chez-les-Blenc, CH-1000 Lausanne 26, Sw tzeriand
Summary
The pul pose of the second Interlaboratory comparison was to evaluate the suitability
of the method reported by Gross for the determination of MelQx, 4,8-DiMai0x, 10,
meta and PhiP in two model Process Flavour samples. As in the previous study, four
independent laboratories - US-FDA laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, Givaucian Ltd. Nestec Ltd - performed determinations following an up-
dated standard operating protocol provided by GA Gross. Three data sets were
available by April 15, 1992. Data of the Givaudan laboratory could not be included in
this update as rto results were reported at the April 15 deadline_ The studied samples
exhibited a very high complexity. The use of a sensitive detection system allowing
on-line peak Identification therefore was required to validate Identified heterocyclic
amines. however, this requirement was Willed only by one of the participants. From
these data heterocyclic amine detection limits in the 5- 10 ng/g range were concluded.
Mel0x could be tentatively identified tit the meal extract containing Process Flavour
sample at a level dose to the detection limit,
A repetition of this study is therefore recommended to obtain information on the repro-
ducibility of the results. EmphatigS should be put on the use of adequale analytical
equipment. Further improvements in the analytical method are requrect to attain a
1 ng/g limit ol detection.
Introduction
Heating of foods containing creatinin, amIrie acids and/or proteins and Sugars induces
the formation of mulagenic heterocyclic amines it] Recently a method for HPLC of ten
mutagenic neterocychc aromatic amines (HAA) and two co-rnutagertic13-carbotines was
reported [2.31, including solid-phase extraction followed by HPLC analysis with ultra-
violet and fluorescence detection. The sensitivity of this method was in the low rig per
gram range. In a first collaborative study with a meat ex1rect as test sample almost 100
rig per gram MelQx and about 15 rig per g 4,8-DiMelQx were measured with little
variation among the participants [4] This second collaborative study was set up to
measure lhe HAA MelQx, 4,8-DiMeiOx, 10. Me10 and PhIP in Process Flavours
(PF). PFs are mixtures of hydrolyzed plant proteins, animal fat, salt, glutamate, ino-
slne monopfx.)sphate and mattodextrin heated tar 30 - 80 minutes at temperatures
above 100*C and are therefore chemically very complex. The method used for meat
extract analySis did not Snew sufficient sensitivity 10 analyze low rig per gram levels
of HAA in PF. An improved analytical method for determining low rig per gram levels of
HAA in PFs was recently described by Gross and Gil:star [51. The standard operating
protocol used in this c_)ottaboraiive study [81 Included these improvements.
riocelostm

Sam plea
Twa PE models were produced by Westreco Ltd.. NewMilford (CT) one sample con-
taining a not declared percentage of the meat extract already analyzed in the first col-
laborative study. However, the samples were labeled as to contain the meet extract
or not.
Standard Operating Protocol (SOP), Reference standards
An updated SOP (61 was handed Out by G. Gross. Reference standard solutions
were preparea at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Two stock solutions were
given to the participants, containing 5 ng/p1 or 0.5 ngltil of each MelOx, 4,8-Ditiael0x,
10, Me10 and PhIP.
The working protocol included analytical determinations ol HAA In both PF samples
using the standard method (Extrelut-PPS extra.cnoreHPLC) as well as the improved
extraction procedure (Extrelut-PFIS followed by TSKCM650 clean-up/HPLC).
Detection limits of HAA In the PF matrix were evaluated by spiking low amounts Of
reference standards Into the samples.
Reaults
HPLC analysis of the model Process Flavours
Figure 1 (top chromatograms) shows an extract chromatogram of the meat extract
containing Process Flavour purified using the standard Extreit.a-PRS procedure. A
Chromatogram of the reference standard mixture is overlaid to show positions where
reference standards elute (inverted chromatograms). in the extract chromatograms a
signiticantly higher level of interferences was found as compared to extract prepared
wan the meat extract alone (compare chromatograms shown in [41) Low ng per gram
level determinations were not possible with These extracts. After an additional purifi-
cation using TSK CM650 the detection of heterocyclic amines was facilitated (Figure 1,
bottom chromatograms) and Spiked compounds were easily identifiable at the 60 nglg
level (shaded peaks). In urrspiked extracts of both Process Flavours small peaks co-
eluting wen MelOx and 4,11-DiMelOx were found (Figure 1, bottom: complete
chromatograms are shown of spiked and unspiked meat extract containing PF ; an
extract of the meat extract - free PF Is shown partially; the Me IQx peaks are identified
by a bold arrow). The identification of MelOx in the meat extract containing Process
Flavour could be tentatively confirmed (Figure 2) using a photodiode array detection
system. This MelOx peak, however, was not completely free of interferences, as can
be seen from the ovettaid reference UV spectrum in Figure 2. From the peak area. a
concentration of 13 nOrg MerfOx was calculated, this value, however is overestimated
due to the co-eluting compound. Other small peaks co-eluting wIth heterocyclic amines
in both PF samples (MelOx , 4,6-DiMelax P111 P, see Figure 3, 25-30 min. time
segments) were unknown compounds.
The detection limits of heterocyclic amines in the meat extract containing Process
Flavour were evaluated by spiking increasing amounts of reference standard solution.
Using the diluted reference standard solution as proposed in the SOP the limit of de-
tection was found to be higher than 2 ng/p1 (no data snown). Spiking reference stare
ciardS at levels ranging from 8 to 48 IVO (Figure 3) allowed to visualize the 5-10 ngig
limit of detection.
Discussion
Process Flavours contain a more complex matrix background than meat extracts or
fried meat or fish samples. The removal of unwanted matrix components using the
566405553

3
purification method described by Gross Was onty partially successful. Therefore the
limits of detection of all investigated neterocy,..11c Mel0x, 4.8-DiMeiOx, 10,
Melia and Philp were about tenfold higher than with meat extract or fried meat sam-
ples, despite the additional purification using TSKCM850 gel
In conclusion, analysis of one ng per gram levels by HPLC/1.11/-FLD of heterocyclic
amines in Process Flavours is only possible with an Improved purification method.
Alternatively. more selective detection systems, e.g.. LCMS (liquid chromatography
Coupled to a mass spectrometer) might prove useful to suppress background peaks.

Mr. John Hallagan, Esq.
FEMA
1620 Eye Street, N.W. Suite 925
Washington, D.C. 20006
Dear Mr. Halligan,
The following comments and tables are presented to supplement
the sampling procedure that was submitted for sampling flavors
for heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA).
The investigation of flavors to determine whether or not they
contain detectable amounts of HAA is a relatively new inquiry and
consequently there are many scientific questions to be answered.
For this reason, a 'stepwise approach is indicated. It is unlikely
that any one study is going to answer all of the questions that
may be posed at this time.
We know that the potential for HAA production is greater when a
flavor contains meat products and is processed at a high
temperature. HAA production is not expected when the flavor does
not contain meat products. The flavors reported in the survey by
FEMA were processed under one of the five temperature-time
conditions discussed previously. These are (A) >150° C and >15
min., 13) >150° C and <15 min., (C) <1500 C and >60 min., (D)
<150° C and <60 min., and (E) simple blending (no heat).
Condition A may be expected to offer the greatest potential for
HAA production with the other conditions offering decreasing
potential for HAA production. For this reason those flavors
processed under condition A ie, >1500 C and >15 min are given
special attention.
There were 23 flavors in the reported survey which were processed
in part or in whole under condition A temperature-time condition
by 4 companies. In the survey that is proposed, similar flavor
samples will be analyzed for each of these 23 flavors that were
reported.
5664.031ISS

STATISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES
It is desirable to sample as many companies as possible since
there may be processing procedures used which may be peculiar to
an individual company. Flavors from companies producing
relatively small amounts of flavors to those making sizeable
amounts will be included in the survey. Attention is paid to
companies contributing to large exposure of flavors.
Table 1 gives information on flavors containing meat products.
These flavors may be heat processed or processed without heat.
Since the flavors that contain meat products and are heat
processed over time are of special interest because of the
potential for the production of HAA, this subset of the flavors
is noted in the table. The table gives the allocation of the 80
samples that were proposed for analysis where factors of special
interest were considered.
Table 2 gives information on flavors not containing meat
products. As noted earlier, HAA production is not expected in
these flavors. The allocation of the 20 samples to be analyzed
is presented where factors of special interest were considered.
In table 3, a star indicates which processing conditions were
employed for flavors in a particular group. For example,
processing conditions A and B were not used for flavors in groups
1, 2, and 8.
If there are any further questions, I will be happy to discuss
them.
Sincerely,
k24.40-4./ZW.0Ai

Thm following points are of special interest:
The Co=ission cannot accept flavouring suletances evaluated Only
by :EOM. rtxx or ?DA. All these subtance& Ileve to be oor-selly
reviawed by the SC' Su-aemittee. IT is the intention of the
Commission to obtain this approval by en accelerated procedure
based on data promized by the F. Mme nealain hat already teem
the sample of narrative suyries prepared in the raik. 2
expLained that it will take some time and effort to prepare suCh

work if the SCr 8mbconnittee reauires the sane enocbt of testing
as the Co! Zxperts. The ecasition of the Subcommittee is noe
definite, but ahe does not know European scientists having
experience Lu flavour evaluation. -
Si aGomslaist has nat seer the STAls, she askea for a sample.
SSA?' uaY Llaa the SLR's as data base for the scr Sul:committee
instead of tbe PID& profile or the narrative summaries.
For non-GRAS 3ubst4nce3 she is waiting for the result of our
inquiry. She requests infnrmatiom am clessificatiem, volume of

these substances to thm same  erated evaluatiot.
All these substances will he reproduced in one uniqua list; with

She explained that the Co--14-7-- procedure will facilitate the
addition of new substances, since the COUDCia proceaare will take
yeArs. : pointed out that tha. counci2 procedure nay allow
industry to interverte when -,)wrarices should be banned; but she
affirmed =At beaming is not the intention of the Commission.
itiportar.t a.soCt, uhich has to he first discussed in :CF: asid
ETTA, is t.le intention of tLe Commission to alendon the
distincti.ot between the different categories of flavolirimg
substances. Thi di tc the logical conclusion 'that ala
vertical discriminations in national com=dity regulations will
have to lot abandonned- The c.-Irn-'-i.sion has the intention to
achieve this bv Art 5_ in the 3rn revised draft, hut the wording
of this Xrticla has still to he ineroved to achieve this goal-
I confirmed ta Mew Geslain that her idea to define the
aceeptability wi flavouring slihstahoes by tha genera/ criteria
of Annex 17 oay solve tan}, p-roblems- Pe discussed er proposed
additions to those criteria- She explained that the BC.' will never
accept substances evaluated elsewhere, all the eva2uations have
to be made under fa responsibility of the ScE. she is more
favorable to the method of priority setting then De. ?enning. She
asked why the proposal of tha ZnA consultant to consider
substances of raak 0-5 as tenporarily admissible has been omitted
fro= the model regulation- Z exoluined that this was done to
avoid a premature discussion of details as lonq al, the gt.nerill

Loon; the less important points, she uxpIained the political
reasons to deal in the draft DirectiVe by foods (request

OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION
JOINT FAO/WHO EXPERT COMMITTEE ON FOOD ADDITIVES
Thirty-ninth meeting, Rome, 3-12 February 1992
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) meeting was held in Rome, Italy,
from 3 to 12 February 1992. The meeting was opened by Mr A.N. Carus, Assistant to the Assistant
Director-General, Economic and Social Policy Department, on behalf of the Directors-General of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and of the World Health Organization.
Professor K. Koiima, College of Environmental Health, Azabu University, Sagamihara-shi,
Kanagawa-ken, Japan, acted as Chairman. Professor M.J. Rand, Department of Pharmacology,
University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, acted as Vice-Chairman.
Dr J. Weatherwax, Food Quality and Standards Service, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, acted as FAO Joint Secretary. Dr J.L. Herrman,
International Programme on Chemical Safety, Division of Environmental Health, World Health
Organization, acted as WHO Joint Secretary.
The present meeting was the thirty-ninth of a series of similar meetings. The tasks before the
Committee were to (a) undertake toxicological evaluations of certain food additives and naturally-
occurring toxicants; (b) review and prepare specifications for selected food additives; and (c) discuss and
advise on matters arising from the Twenty-third Session of the Codex Committee on Food Additives and
Contaminants_
The report of the meeting will appear in the WHO Technical Report Series. Its presentation will
be similar to that of previous reports, namely, general considerations, comments on specific substances,
and recommendations for further work. The text will include a detailed table (similar to Table I in this
summary) summarizing the main conclusions reached by the Committee in terms of acceptable daily
intakes (ADIs) and other toxicological recommendations. Information on specifications for the identity
and purity of certain food additives examined by the Committee will also be included.
In assessing the substances on the agenda, the Committee took into consideration the principles
established and contained in "Principles for the safety assessment of food additives and contaminants in
foods", World Health Organization, 1987, (WHO Environmental Health Criteria, No. 70).
7,
Specifications for the identity and purity of the compounds listed in Table 1 marked as N; N,T; R
or R,T will be published in the FAO Food and Nutrition Paper Series. Specifications for substances
marked as S and ST have been previously published in that series.
Toxicological monographs or monograph addenda will be published on many of the substances on
the agenda in WHO Food Additives Series, No. 30.

Notes to Table 1
1. N, new specifications prepared; Ft, existing specifications revised; S, specifications exist, revision
not considered or not required; and T, the existing, new, or revised specifications are tentative and
comments are invited (see Table 2).
2. Based on sucrose esters contained in sucrose esters of tarry acids and sucroglycericles.
3. ADI "not specified" means that, on the basis of the available data (chemical, biochemical,
toxicological, and other), the total daily intake of the substance arising from its use at the levels
necessary to achieve the desired effect and from its acceptable background in food, does not, in
the opininon of the Committee, represent a hazard to health. For that reason, and for the reasons
stated in the individual evaluations, the establishment of an Ara expressed in numerical form is
not deemed necessary.
4. This enzyme is derived from edible animal tissue commonly used as food; therefore, it may be
regarded as food.
5. See Table 2.
6. Applies to total intake of limonene. Intake of limonene as a food additive should not exceed 0.075
mg/kg bw/day, which represents 5% of the ADI.
7. Should be limited to use as an extraction solvent for spice oleoresins and deraffeination of coffee
and tea and for food additives in which previous specifications elaborated by the Committee
included residues of dichlorometna_ne.
8. Beeswax is used as a releale and glazing agent in bakery products, glazing agent on fresh and
frozen fruit, glazing agent on candy, carrier for flavours, and component in chewing gum bases.
9. Candelilla wax is used as a glaring agent, component of chewing gum base, surface finishing
agent, and carrier for flavouring substances).
10. Group ADI for microcrystalline and paraffin waxes for uses listed in the specifications.
11. Shellac is used as a coating, glazing, and surface-finishing agent externally applied to food.
12. The direct addition of furfural to food as a flavouring substance is not appropriate and its use as
an extraction solvent should be restricted to situations in which alternatives are not available, such
as for purification of food oil by extracting unsaturated components.

MEMORANDUM - April 17, 1992
TO: James L. Emerson
Richard L. Hall
Fred H. Stults
FROM: Earl C. Klinger
SUBJECT: Safety Evaluation Budget
Enclosed is a report of Safety Evaluation expenses
for FY 1991-92.
If expenses are viewed alone, they ended up
$122,000 below budget for the year. However, the
Safety Evaluation budget was adopted with the
understanding that a significant part of those expenses
would be offset by income from related sources, much of
which did not materialize (i.e. Expert Panel fees and
computer database sales).
When the offsetting income shortfall is taken into
account, the net Safety Evaluation underexpenditure is
reduced to $21,000. This amount is not sufficient to
absorb the charges of approximately $61,000 being
requested by RIFM.
Most other areas of FEMA's FY 1991-92 budget were
also underspent. The preliminary year-end figures show
an overall operating surplus for the year of about
$290,000. $155,000 of this surplus had been planned by
the Board for restoration of the reserve, so the
1991-92 surplus is really about $135,000 more than
originally expected.
If payment of the $61,000 billed by RIFM is
authorized, the reserve restoration during FY 1991-92
will be reduced by that amount, from $290,000 to
$229,000. The reserve at the beginning of FY 1991-92
was $218,000; it would still be doubled even if the
52 YEARS OF SERVCE TO THE FLAYOJI INDUSTRY
5€6405G53

RIFM payment is approved. (Howard Smith should be consulted
before making such a recommendation.)
The question of how to include annual payments of this
magnitude into the FY 1992-93 and subsequent budgets also needs
to be addressed.
P.S. My report to you of April 14th on the File Update expenses
incorrectly showed the staff support cost for 1991-92 to be
$15,200. The correct figure should have been $17,300, as shown
in the report accompanying this memo, resulting in total File
Update expenses of $72,600.

MEMORANDUM - April 14, 1992
TO: James L. Emerson
Richard L. Hall
Fred H. Stults
FROM: Earl C. Klinger 104--
SUBJECT: Detail of "File Update" Expenses
As agreed during our telephone conference
yesterday, I have prepared the attached breakdown of
expenses charged during FY 1991-92 (ending 3/31/92) to
the "File Update" section of the Safety Evaluation
budget. Total expenses were $S4Tfric1141,-11-0-Q0.
It will still be a day or two before I can answer
the question about how much of the total 91-92 Safety
Evaluation budget has not been spent. FEMA keeps it's
book on an accrual basis, which means that we have to
identify and add in expenses payable (incurred but not
actually paid) as of 3/31/92; we have to wait for
certain vendor invoices to complete this adjustment.

PROPOSAL FOR A COUNCIL REGULATION
ESTABLISHING A LIST OF FLAVOURING SUBSTANCES USED
IN FOODSTUFFS
AND AMENDING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 88/388/EEC
/ la
5664 05666

- 2 -
Explanatory note
1. Article 5 paragraph 1 of directive 88/388/EEC foresees that:
The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down In
article 100A of the Treaty, shall adopt appropriate provisions
concerning:
- flavouring sources composed of foodstuffs, and of herbs and spices
normally considered as foods,
- flavouring sources composed of vegetable or animal raw materials
not normally considered as foods,
- flavouring substances obtained by appropriate physical processes or
by enzymatic or microbiological processes from vegetable or animal
raw materials,
- chemically synthesized or chemically isolated flavouring substances
chemically Identical to flavouring substances naturally present in
foodstuffs or in herbs and spices normally considered as foods,
chemically synthesized or chemically Isolated flavouring substances
chemically identical to flavouring substances naturally present in
vegetable or animal raw materials not normally considered as foodS,
- chemically synthesized or chemically Isolated flavouring substances
other than those referred to In the fourth and fifth Indents,
- source materials used for the production of smoke flavourings or
process flavourings, and the reaction conditions under which they
are prepared."
This regulation deals with flavouring substances. Other regulations will
be proposed for the other categories of flavours.
2. The Scientific Committee for Food has been consulted in December 1991
concerning the principles for the safety evaluation of flavouring
substances. Its opinion Is published ( ). Its recommends that
flavouring substances should be subject to an appropriate safety
evaluation. The Committee agreed to take Into account the findings of
Council of Europe (Committee of experts on flavourings). Food and drug
administration (FDA) and Flavours and Extracts Manufacturers
Association (FEMA). The Committee has also defined criteria for the
safety evaluation of flavouring substances.
566405667

-3-
3. This regulation defines genera! criteria (annex III) for the use of
flavouring substances in foodstuffs. On the basis of this general
criteria and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food, a first
community list of flavouring substances has been laid down (annex O.
Annex I Includes all flavouring substances considered acceptable by
the Scientific Committee for Food.
4. Before 1st January 1997, other substances than those mentioned In
Annex I may be used provided they conform to the criteria of Annex
111. From 1st January 1997, only substances listed In Annex 1, will
be allowed In foodstuffs.
5. in order to take Into account technical and scientific evolutions, the
Commission will amend the Community list In cooperation with the
Standing Committee for Foodstuffs. This revision will be done on the
basis of the general criteria defined In Annex III, after consultation
of the Scientific Committee for Food.
6. Food for infants and young children are subject to specific
provisions, following the opinion of the Scientific Committee for
Food. Infant formulae and follow-on formulae must not contain added
flavouring substances. Annex II lays down a list of flavouring
substances which may be added to other follow-up foods and baby-foods,
as mentioned in Council Directive 89/398/EEC.
7. This regulation lays down a list of foodstuffs (unprocessed foodstuffs
and certain other foodstuffs) that may not contain added flavouring
substances.
8. Finally, this regulation Includes a modification of the definition of
"process flavour" (article 1 paragraph 2 point d of directive
88/388/EEC) in order to take into account the technical developments

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
With regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and
In particular article 100A thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
in cooperation with the European Parliament,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee.
Having regard to the Council directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the
aPProxlmatIon of the laws of the Member States relation to flavourings for
use in foodstuffs end to source materials for their production, and In
particular article 5 paragraph 1 third, fourth, fifth and sixth indents
thereof.
After consultation with the Scientific Committee for Food.
Whereas differences between national laws relating to flavourings hinder
the free movement of foodstuffs and may create conditions of unequal
competition, thereby directly affecting the establishment or functioning of
the common market,
Whereas the approximation of those laws Is necessary if the free movement
of foodstuffs is to be achieved,
Whereas, according to the scope and effects of the proposed action, the
Community measures envisaged by this regulation are not necessary but
indispensable for the attainment of the stated objectives and that these
objectives cannot be achieved by Member-States individually,
Whereas laws relating to flavourings for use In foodstuffs should take
account primarily of human health requirements as well as within the limit
required for the protection of health, of economic and technical needs,
Whereas it Is necessary to establish the general criteria for the use of
flavouring substances,
Whereas On the basis of the most recent scientific advice It is necessary
to lay down a list of flavourings substances that may be used In food,
Whereas the huge number of flavouring substances which have to be evaluated
by the Scientific Committee for Food will not enable a Community positive
list to be established immediately, and therefore it is necessary to
Foresee provisional measures,
Whereas these provisional measures shell make It possible for the use of
substances not mentioned In this regulation provided consumer's health Is
guaranteed,
Whereas after 1st January 1997 only substances mentioned in the Community
list will be allowed In foodstuffs,
Whereas it may be necessary for health reasons to adopt conditions of use
for certain flavouring substances,
566405669

- 5 -
Whereas on the most recent scientific advice, Infant formulae and follow-on
formulae must not contain added flavouring substances, and weaning foods
and baby foods as mentioned In Council Directive 69/398/EEC shall contain a
limited number of flavouring substances,
Whereas It Is generally recognised that unprocessed foodstuffs and certain
other basic foodstuffs should be free from food additives.
• Whereas the scientific Committee for Food set up by' ommission Decision
74/234/EEC should be consulted before provisions liable to affect public
health are adopted under specific directives
Whereas It must be possible to adapt the Community list to scientific and
technical developments,
Whereas in order to simplify and expedite the procedure of revision of the
list, the adoption of these measures should be entrusted to the Commission,
Whereas It is desirable that In all cases where the Council empowers the
Commission to Implement rules relating to foodstuffs, provision should be
made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member
States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on foodstuffs set
up by Council Decision 69/414/EEC,
Whereas It Is desirable to modify article 1 of directive 88/388/EEC In
order to adapt the definition of process flavours to technical
developments.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION.
Article 1
1. This regulation Is establishing the appropriate provisions concerning
flavouring substances as It Is foreseen In article 5 paragraph 1,
third, fourth, fifth and sixth Indents of Council Directive
88/388/EEC.

INTRODUCTION
DR. SHUBEK: We have a complex series of papers which I think bear on many aspects of problems
that we all face, and we arc very fortunate to have Dr. Alvan Feinstein who is Sterling Professor of Medicine
and Epidemiology at Yale University to chair this meeting and to kick off the session with a basic introductory
lecture.
DT. Feinstein?
WEAK EPIDEMIOLOGIC ASSOICATIONS
AND THE LIMITATIONS OF META-ANALYSIS
Alvan R. Feinstein
Yale University School of Medicine, Connecticut
DR. FEINSTEllq: Thank you, Dr. Shubile It is a pleasure to be here and to join this group in
discussing the profundities, complexities, oversimplifications and major intellectual problems of the issues that
we are talking about.
I have been asked by the person who is custodian of lights, manuscripts and whatnot to urge all speakers
to be sure to speak into the microphone, and when you get up to ask questions, please state your name and
institution so that the people who transcribe these phenomena will know who it is that is being recorded_
The session today is devoted to the majestic new technique called meta-analysis, to problems of low-level
things, both in terms of low-level statistical associations and in exposures to low levels of the so-called "toxic
substances" that people are exposed to, and that is a very tricky business. What has made it in recent years
particularly popular has been the development of meta-analysis which I am sure all of you have been exposed
to and oppressed by. So,! will not attempt to define it, but I will try to comment on it if I can figure out how
to get the first slide.
(Slide) If we ask what are the fundamental requirements of scientific evidence, they are reproducibility
and identification of the material and data that we deal with They are precision in characterization of the
material we deal with so that we can look for various kinds of purifications that will allow us to characterize
homogeneous substances rather than the heterogeneous mixtures and when we make comparisons we want them
to be fair and unbiased. I think just about everyone would accept that those are some fundamental operating
guides in scientific- reasoning.
Now, the great appeal of meta analyses is that they can convert existing things into something better,
that statistical signiEcance may be attained when small sample 517es ale pooled in a big one or that new
hypotheses, not originally tested or that had inconclusive results can be examined for special subgroups or other
entities. That is the great appeal of meta-analysis.
The disadvantasre is that if one gets completely carried away by the statistics and forgets about what is
actually being done, one may forget that the scientific reorcx:locibility of identification and fairness of comparison
may be lost amid the het eri.lgeneou.s mixtures
It is for this reason that I often think of meta-analysis as an alchemy, a statistical alchemy for the 21st
century. It has the same advantage of alchemy, ot couveitiug existing things into something better, such as
changing basa nietals into gold, and it lias the same •iiSailvar.i.ige, that before the reprodujb1c preciion cf
177
566405677

modern chemistry substances were heterogeneous mixtures of earth, air, fire and water. That didn't keep the
alchemists from doing some quite wonderful things, and many of the residues of the old days that we see in gold,
in statues and various other ornaments were done with that old alchemy, but there was, also, a great deal of
scientific stuff that was absolute nonsense.
In the criteria and problems in collecting data for meta-analysis, the idea is to establish a protocol and
make blind decisions to avoid bias when the studies are assembled and reviewed. Not too many people establish
such a protocol and not too many people make blind decisions, but in the better techniques that is vvhat should
be done. Regardless of whether this is done or not, what becomes avaialble for assembly and review may be
distorted by the phenomenon of publication bias which is the tendency of published papers to contain an
unbalanced array of positive results.
The way that that arises is from at least three phenomena. In the so-called -fde drawer phenomenon
investigators may be discouraged by negative results and they file them and never submit them for publication.
In editorial selection bias, the reviewers and editors may turn down negative studies even when submitted
because they find that the negative results are unexciting or not newsworthy.
There is the random outlier phenomenon in that using a P value of less than .05 as the criterion one
in every 20 statistical studies of a non-positive relationship may be positive by chance alone, but that may then
be the study that is particularly likely and submitted_ So, for all of these reasons' the literature is particularly
likely to have publications bias in it, and anyone who wants to do a fair meta-an'alysis is then beholden to make
major inquiries to try to find out what may be out there that has been done but not published. Such inquiries
are relatively rare.
Now, if we think about scientific problems tend cause-effect relationships in general, we have a sequence
of causal thinking in which somebody in some baseline state is exposed to the compared maneuvers. There are
then the outcome events and the collection of data, and the main source of bias in all this is that susceptiloility
at baseline may be unequal because the compared groups may have an unequal risk or prognostic suseepalility
to the outcome event. That happens all the time, for instance, when surgery is chosen as treatment for localized
cancer and the metastatic cancers are then given radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
The second problem in performance of the maneuvers is that they may be given with unequal proficiency
or the compared groups may have a whole bunch of other maneuvers that may, also, be having active effects that
are not considered. The problem in the outcome is that it may be detected unequally because of differences in
surveillance testing or criteria for interpretation.
The problem of transfer bias occurs when the collection of analyzed data at the outcome, after it has
occurred does not include members of the cohorts who have been lost in unequal numbers and reason. That
is a well-known collection of biases, and randomized trials were established as the gold standard for causal
reasoning in this century in an effort to avoid those problems.
What I want to do in the next two slides is to give. you a catalog of these different problems, look at the
way they are managed in the gold standard of randomized trials and compare that with the way the same
problems are managed in most meta-analyses.
If the problem to be avoided is susceptibility bias, we want the two groups under comparison to have
similar baseline states before the causal comparative maneuvers were imposed. In a randomized trial those two
maneuvers are assigned by randomization to avoid this problem. In meta-analysis even if the original studies
were done with raatlocaizatioia, when you pool them into the meta-a aalytic combine you have diffeteot groups
being combined.
With performance bias we want a similar proficiency of the compared maneuvers and in a randomized
trial a common protocol tends to provide that kind of assurance. In meta-analysis there are: diverse maneuvers
123
566405678

and co-maneuvers all being thrust together through the cloaca into the common pool in which everything is
assembled.
If the problem to be avoided is detection bias, the scientific goal is a similar identification of outcomes.
In randomized trials double blinding is used to try to avoid that problem whenever possible and a common
protocol is used to pick the same outcomes to be identified. In ma-analyses different events and methods of
describing the outcome events are regularly combined.
With transfer bias we want a complete accounting for all members of the cohort who were exposed to
the compared maneuvers. In a randomized trial life table analyses are used to try to provide that kind of
accounting and., also, the so-called 'intention to tre-at" analyses are applied to carry out the same principle.
In meta-analyses, a complete accounting is not assured and may not be priasible. When you take a
case-controlled study, for example., that is a study that begins at the end with the people already having been
=posed to whatever they were going to be exposed to. You are getting them at the outcome, and you have no
idea who may have entered that cohort and who was lost or pursued or not pursued when you assembled the
cases and controls at the end of the pathway. All am trying to point out here is simply that just about every
scientific problem that randomized trials were intended to deal with and that they have very well dealt with is
ignored in the tactic of getting meta-analytic approaches.
There are some special problems in meta-analyses because the groups, have heterogeneous baseline
states due to differences in clinical severity and comorbid severity that are not identified even in most
randomized trials. If you try to pool patients with the same cancer, even if they were in the same randomized
trial, the method of characterizing patients with cancer in this century, alas, is based on morphology alone,
describing only the form of the. cancer under the microscope and its anatomic spread with absolutely no attention
to the functional impact of the cancer on the patients, whether they feel well, have lost weight, arc vomiting their
heads off, unable to function; none of that appears in any of the existing literature, of randomized trials, that
when you pool the groups, even for cancer, you are not sure of what kind of mixtures are being combined in
those results.
The outcome events in the original data may have different statistical expressions, such as deaths per
person or per person year or odds ratios that abate the denominator so that you have no idea of what the actual
rate of events is, and all of these are neeessary in order to convert everything to some common statistical
measure of effect so that things can be pooled, but the things that you might most want to know about death
rates or survival rates arc very often lost during all of these combinations, and furthermore, for many years the
meta-analyzers said, 'We have got to do it only with randomized trials data. That is the only information that
is really scientific_ It is the only stuff we can really trust," but in recent years the industry of naeta-analysis has
exuberantly expanded so that people can now use cohort data, case-controlled data, something left over from
grandmother's streudel recipe data; anything you can find is eligible to be put in and so that we can have
case-controlled and cohort data that do not even have the basic scientific quality of the raw evidence in
randonaized controlled trials.
Those are some of the various problems in meta-analyses, and I am not attempting to denounce them.
As I said earlier, like alchemy, they can sometimes produce some useful things, but if oue is attempting to use
standards of modern chemistry, this is unquestionably a form of statistical alchemy that may or may not be useful
when it produces its results.
The second thing that I wanted to comment on was i.S.Skles of weak association_ We have an extra
speaker thic morning Dr. Ernst Wynder who is going to follow me, and my unpin ems on weak associations, in
which Dr. Wynder is a particularly authoritative speaker, will be quite limited. i just wanted to point out how
some of them can occur for people who may not necessarily be statistical rocket scientists and who may not
appreciate how a lot of these ratios are tin own together.
566405679

Suppose we look at what is called a risk ratio. The way one gets that is you might find that the rate in
an exposed group is 10 per 10,000 or .001. If the rate in the non-exposed group is 90 per 90,000, and there are
usually more non-exposed people than there are exposed, and hence the larger denominator here, that rate is
.1001. The two rates are divided to get what is called the relative risk or risk ratio and to guard against the threat
of clarity there are about eight other expressions for this thing, but all of it is in essence the relative risk or risk
ratio, and you divide these two things, and you get one, and that is the situation where exposure hasn't done
a.nything.
A major problem that most clinicians are aware of but that has not percolated over into the churches
of epidemiology is the issue of detection bias. Most diseases, particularly cancers are not necessarily diagnosed
during life. People do not walk around with a sign that says, "I have cancer of the omphalus" or whatever, and
they are detected with special tests. If the tests are not done during life, if the cancer is not symptomatic enough
to evoke the tests, it may not be picked up. Consequently there may be a great many cancers that arc not
necessarily diagnosed during life although all of the so-called "rates" of dise2se rely on those diagnoses made
during life.
You may very well have situations where the average detection of disease is increased in the exposed
group and decreased in the unexposed group. For example, ill set up a program of mammography screening
in industry A, I guarantee you I can begin to put that industry out of business. There will be discovered in the
women workers of that industry many more breast cancers than will be found in industry B which does not have
the mammography screening program. When the rates of the higher breast 'cancers in industry A in the
mammograph screened group are compared agpincr the rates in industry B it v3ill never occur to anyone that the
mammography may have made the difference. It will be whatever those poor women were exposed to industry
A, manufacturing chicken soup or whatever it was doing that turns out to be toxic to the public in comparison
to industry B.
Can that happen? It not only happens, but it happens all the time, and it is constantly neglected in
epidemiologic data, so that if you have, for instance, just a 10 percent rise in the detection rate of the exposed
group and a 10 percent lessening from the average in the unexposed group, you can get in your exposed cases
11 per 10,000 instead of 10, the example I gave you before. In the non-exposed group you would get 81 instead
of 90, as in the example before. These two rates go this way, and when you plumb them around, you get a ratio
of 1.22, 20 percent rise. If you have detection changes of 20 percent higher detection in the exposed and 20
percent less than average in the unexposed, this goes up to 12; that goes down to 72. When you plunk that
around, it is up to 1.5. You can get changes of those levels without anything happening, other than simply the
way in which people go about being tnedicalized and having their diseases detected.
Now, during the studies that I just talked about, getting, say, 10,000 people or 90,000 people, that is a
lot of work to do, and that is, you know, actually you have to commit yourself to a long time, get funded for that
project, and it is much easier instead to do the so-called 'case-controlled' study.
Now, in a cohort study you wind up with the same A, E, C, D, four by four table and for the risk ratio
it is going to be A over A plus B, C over C plus D and when you work out all that arithmetic this is what the
risk ratio turns out to be.
In a case-controlled study, if your cases represent the universe accurately, and they almost never do, if
your controls represent the universe accurately, and they almost never do, then if you do this AD over BC cross
product, that is the odds ratio, and it so happens that when the rate of disease is small, attack rates of about 1
per 1000,5 per 1000, which is the customary rate for most cancers, the values of A and C are very small relative
to B and D, and so, this thiitg approximates I) over E, and so, the risk ratio approximates the odds ratio.
It was that piece of mathematical legerdemain that has allowed the odds ratio to become such a popular
and venerated index of risk.
130
....I
566405680 .1

Now, with the odds ratio, you get your eases and controls, and you find out who was exposed and not
exposed, and you bang the products together, and if you had, say, 50 cases and 100 contras, not the tens of
thousands of patients that I was talking about before, that is the nice thing about case-controlled studies with
50 and 100 you are all set_ If everything worked out well, you get 10 out of 40, 21] out of 100. When you do the
odds ratio, it comes out to one gorgeous, perfect, direct representation of the universe out there, but if this is
your actual situation, all you need is one iniselassific.ation. If you have an 11. and 39 instead of 10 and 40, your
odds ratio goes up to 112. If you happen to have two misclassifications, with 11 and 39 in 1981, it goes up to L2.
If you had one ease in whom the data are unknown, and you have got one extra control, it can make it to L25,
and with two misclassified cases and controls there you are at 1_44, in the New York Times, the Today Show and
wherever else you might like to be.
That is a very important thing to bear in mind, that micrlasaications can occur very eA6ly and can raise
the odds ratios, and it was for this reason that Dr. Wynder and his group of pundits in several meetingc in the
past and various other thoughtful people have said that if the odds ratios or risk ratios are below two, we cannot
take them seriously.
I would point out that statement to you. They are below two, even if you have got a big enough N to
get so-called "statistical  ignificance," you cannot take them seriously if they are below two, and yet I would guess
that most of the odds ratios and risk ratios we are going to be seeing today arc substantially less than two.
Anyhow, with those words, I am going to ask Ernie Wynder to comei up. Dr_ Wynder is famous as one
of the very first people to discern the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. I think be did that when
he was a medical student, the day before yesterday, and Dr. Wynder is now president of the American Health
Association in New York City.
Ernie?

Ernest Wynder, M.D.
American Health Association, NY
DR. WYNDER: Thank you very much, Alvan. It is always a great pleasure to be on the same program
with you and to be here in Aspen.
Incidentally, an odds ratio of two, if it were really significant, and it if involved a large number of people,
would nevertheless be of public health significance. Fortunately, I started with an odds ratio of 20 or 30 when
I first looked at smoking and lung cancer more than 40 years ago. I was no statistician. In fact, we had no
statistician at Washington University. Thus, I did the first study without the lxacfit of stitialics. In fact, I feel
today that if you need a lot of statistics you already have a problem. Epidemickgy is a phase of medicine that
requires biological plausibility and biological thinking A problem today is that almost anybody with any kind
of degree thinks they can write a paper on epideiniology. It was in 1954, that I reported on the criteria of
causation, which later was enlarged by Bradford Hill into a criteria of judgment. While we in the early fifties
considered such criteria today, when low odds ratios are reported, rarely do we see any criteria of judgment
discussed (Slide 1).
Now, when we study the epidemiology of weak associations, we begin with case-control or cohort studies.
I have done all of my work on case-control studies. The first mistake that is generally made is in selection of
cases or controls, or where they are interviewed. All of our cases have come from hospitals. All of our controls
also have come from hospitals. We know how to adjust for confounders. I just do not know how anybody can
accurately do an hour interview by telephone, particularly, when many interviews are done on proxies. In a
recent study, proxies were asked about hair dye use by rnses and controls. I am reminded of the advertising that
says, "Only she knows for sure." I don't know how many of you know the precise hair dye use of our spouse or
parent. I, for one, would not use proxies in that setting.
(Slide 2) This slide is on weak associations. Besides case-control selection, there are the four other
areas where most of the problems occur. I will not talk about subgroup analysis, but I see papers where they
must have done 103 subgroup analyses. In general, one does not know how many have been done.
Let me talk about biases, confounders and measurement errors. The confounding is an area that some
investigators do not fully consider. Dr. Berger and I took thousands of our control cases and tried to show how
these variables are interrelated (Slides 3, 4). The two major confounders were age and education. Some studies
of adjust for education only as more high school or less than high school, or for age within a 10-year bracket.
Age and education in both men and women are highly correlated to a whole number of variables. One variable
that most of us wouldn't consider is active smoking is highly confounded to fat consumption. The more- you
smoke, the higher is your fat consumption.
On the other hand, smoking is negatively correlated to the intake of fruits and vegetables. Alcohol is
obviously highly =related to smoking. It is, also, highly correlated to religion. As a case in point, some years
ago a study summated a relationship of hair dye to cancer of the breast. Their mistake was that they didn't adjust
for religion. It so happened that in New York Jewish women use more hair dyes than tett religious groups
of women. They also have more breast cancer. When we adjusted the data for religion, the difference
disappeared.
Smoking, of course, also relates to occupation. (Slide 5) You not only must examine whether people
smoke or not but also you must consider how much they smoke and the tar value. The Lower their occupational
scale, the more people smoke. Among blue collar workers, 40 percent are still smoking. Now, if I took a survey
here, how many of you still smoke today?
137
5664ose.ta

Well, if you were, you probably wouldn't admit it.
(Laughter.)
DR. WYNDER: I will talk about that in a moment but if you adjust for an occupation you had better
get very good data on number of cigarettes smoked and amount smoked.
For those who are interested in pregnancy factors, we find that blacks who have the same rate of breast
cancer as whites have the age of first pregnancy much earlier than whites. Aga of first pregnancy relates to
education, to number of children, and probably to dietary factors. So, any one dealing with pregnancy factors
have these confounders to consider.
In respect to wish bias, there arc two kinds. Those in industry, of course, say, 'No, it couldn't possibly
happen to me.' This is a problem that those who work in industry have, but we generally believe that those in
academia have no such bias. That is, of course, not true. As Alvan just said, if I report an odds ratio of L2,
I more readily get into a journal. This does not only apply to the epidemiologist. It applies to the chemist who
just found 2 parts per billion of carcinogen dust in a stone that he found in Alaska, and that certainly gets more
attention than finding nothing.
Next, we come to the interviewee. As an example of interviewee bias there is a place near New York
City called Southampton. If you are rich enough to have a home there, you obviously know how to drive there,
lini,qi you take a helicopter. If asked, 'How long does it take to go from New York to Southampton?" the
homeowner says, "Not very long. I make it in 1 hour and 35 minutes." This is 90 miles. Then you ask the control
who is too poor to have a house in Southampton. He says, "I couldn't possibly live in Southampton because it
takes 3 hours to get there." So, the point I am making is that interviewee bias may well be different for case and
controt
Today, when breast cancer patieuts are interviewed as to, I say, 'How much fat do you eat?" They arc
apt to say,
'Oh, Doctor, I don't eat much fat,' because they may know about fat having read about it in the New York
Times.
In regard to sexual activity, how many women with cervix cancer, do you think give you the precise
answer in terms of number of sexual partners?
Here is an interesting study that I wish I had done. From Australia, Stewart showed that if you ask
people how tall and how short they arc, the older they are, the more they over report their height, and with
women they tend to cut down a few pounds under what they actually weigh (Slides 6-7). Perhaps many of you
recognize yourselves in that chart, and I, for one, happen to be 5'10-1/2" but I like to say, "Five-eleven." It
sounds better.
The.st then are typical examples about interview bias. Some years ago I did a study on circumcision.
I asked people, 'Are you or are you not circumcised?* and then when they didn't know, I examined them later
on, and I found that 30 percent gave us the wrong answer.
(Laughter.)
DR. WYNDF:R: There arc two possibilities. First, they thought circumcision was the thing to do, or
secondly, if they weren't, maybe I would ask them to be circumcised Now, here is a wish bias we find in
occupation studies. We found no relationship to diesel exposure in occupation when wc asked, "Are you exposed
to diesel exhaust?" A sufficient number of cases say, 'Yes," so that the odds ratio remained significant, but I
believe it is a normal, whether it is diesel or whether it is asbestos or sonic other occupation, that case may give
you a biased answer (Slide 8).
566405683
133

In dietary we have a problem with confounders and erroneous measurement. There are but small
variations within our population in the United States compared with worldwide differences_ Therefore, we
believe dietary history within a population is useless (Slide 9). If you just take one example, variables of meat
intake, there are at least seven variables that will determine how much fat you have actually consumed, and the
only thing about meat that we find that is worth inquiring about is, "Do you like your meat well done, rare or
medium'? and/or "How much gravy do you use?" which is of interest to my colleague, Dr. Adamson because
of heterocyclic amines (Slide 10). We need to know what our limitations are. Sometimes animal research is
useful. Dr. Hoffman and his colleagues have produced a pancreatic tumor in mice with NNK, yet when these
animals are placed on a high corn oil diet, more and larger tumors occurred. We need to examine whether
linoleic acid acts as a tumor promoter in human cancers by adversely affecting the immune system (Slide 10)
I am just giving this as one example because at the American Health Foundation, with the support of
the National Cancer Institute, we have been able to build up a truly interdisciplinary institution ranging from
molemilar biology to epidemiology, to health promotion, to child health education. It is my hope that there arc
more institutions that in an interdisciplinary way look the same way at preventive medicine the same way as
comprehensive cancer centers look at therapy.
Now, in terms of the amount of exposure, "micro-exposure" such as one part per billion is equivalent
to one second in 32 years_ Further, anatomic defences — animals have magnificent turbinates that can deal with
environmental exposure to inhalants. The respiratory epithelium is also a significant defense aglinst air pollution
which is unlikely to cause lung cancer. The final point relates again to the criteria of judgment (Slide). All of
us, whether dealing with macro-exposure or micro-exposure, must consider all of these criteria of judgment,
including biological plausibility, oftentimes even with a given report, authors do not consider consistency studies
like duration or amount of exposure or inconsistency between studies or time trends.
Let inc conclude by emphasi7ing that we consider of epidemiology a true art of preventive medicine.
It is more than just citing statistics. You have got to be a good diagnostician and biological thinker. What we
say here has enormous public health significance and political implications. It is important that what we say is
perceived by the public as true science since in the long run true science will always prevail.

DISCUSSION
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Wynder. We have time for about 9 minutes of discussion before
we turn to the next paper_
Are there questions, comments, remarks from the audience, rebuttals, expostulations?
Yes, sir?
DR. WAGNER: Wagner, New York University. how do we reintroduce biology into meta-analysis?
DR. FEINSTEIN: That is a very tough question, Bernie. It has been allowed to go so far by the
biologists with so much statistical hegemony and domination of it that at this point it may be very difficult to try
to get any biology back, and many of the biologists that I know who might be the very people to protest and to
try to get some biology back are the people who will, also, say, "Look, I cannot fight with the statistics. One of
the reasons I went into biology was that I hated math,*
So, it is a very difficidi job. I think perhaps the main thing if there are some gutsy biologists around,
and I will include clinical merficiao here as a subset of biology and public health as a subset of biology, if there
are gutsy biologists around who are willing to take on the onslaught that they will get that says, "You are
igaaorant; you don't understand; you really don't know, shut up," etc., and also, take the risk that their future
grants will be denied by representatives of the same mafia who run the meta-analytic thing, then some
improvements might occur, but at the moment I am not sure how to do it, except with that kind of
counterrevolution.
DR. WYNDER: Alvan, I think the mistake in meta-analysis is usually made right at the beginning, in
my opinion because of biased reporting. You know, we always say, 'In garbage, out garbage," and the problem
as I see it is the patient has a different bias to the question as a controL As I interview patients with coronary
artery disease, and I say, "You know, you cat much fat," the guy will probably underreport by 10 or 20 percent,
but the control who just came from the raft here in Aspen says, 'Look how well I am, and I eat four eggs a day."
So, I don't see enough in our studies about the bias that relates both in a prospective and retrospective study
because almost any question that anybody asks today has some kind of societal influence as to whether or not
it is good or bad, and I rarely see a paper that even discusses biases in the discussion, and another point, Alvan,
as you know, sometimes I see the reservations in the discussion, and then I read the abstract, and the abstract
reads as if it was made from the New York Times, and all the reservations that we see in the discussion itself,
and then I see sometimes in the discussion it will say, 'One point four," you know, one of your figures, with a
confidence limit of .9 to 1.4, and you may want to comment what that confidence limit says.
The confidence limits will not be in the abstracts and out of the 1.4 will become a 40 percent increase
in the abstract, and that I think is the bias that we have as reporters, as scientists, and that i55 bias that we see
in certain journals, and I hope you don't see it in your or my journal.
Could you comment on the meaning of confidence limits? It seems so simple, but people report a 1.4
even though the lower confidence limit dissects(?) one.
DR. FEINSTEIN: The confidence game is not simple at all. It is a confidence game, and there are
an awful lot of shells being juggled around. I mean one of the rules is that the null hypothesis which would be
one for an odds ratio or a risk ratio should not be included in the confidence interval. If it is to be statistically
significant, you must exclude the null hypothesis value of one. So, nowadays, as we have the mafia shouting, "No
more P values, only confidence limits," the confidence limit is basically an inverted P value. They are selling you
the same drug but under a different label, and you are now supposed to take it orally rather than intravenously,
but one point is that that confidence interval is going to be as big or as small as you want it to be according to
5:6641051683
140

what you choose as your alpha level, and what regularly happens now is somebody does a confidence interval
and at the lower end it goes down to about 0.8 which implies that the exposure is protective, but the upper end
goes up to about 4.6 which implies not only is it a risk, but it is an oy vay risk_
With that kind of risk, you immediately get your public relations group to issue the press release, but
you, of course, write the paper very carefully. Somebody else can look at that and say, "You have got a
confidence interval that wide, your sample size is just too damn small; it is not statistically significant. Shut up."
But nowadays people want to get grants and want the publicity so that they focus on that 4.2 and hosanna
DR. WYNDER: While we have got you here as a statistical teacher, another thing that gets me right
here is logistic regression analysis —
DR. FEINSTEIN: Could you point to the exact location. So, I can be sure.
(Laughter.)
DR. WYNDER: Right here. My bias is my heart is here. Somebody reports on let us say 20 CACI.;
He got let us say 12 variables, and he does logistical regression analysis where of course the OR hardly ever
moves and that misr2ke is done all the time, and I am wondering how many cells are blank. Is this another
major game that we play today with statistical packages?
DR. FEINSTEIN: In the 19th century it was very profitable to sell snake oil, and as we approach the
21st century, people will not buy snake oil unless it is accompanied by logistic regression.
(Laughter.)
DR. FEINSTEIN: The problem is that usually the education in statistics is so terrible, and the biology
oriented people are so turned off by it and find it so repugnant that whatever courses they took sent them into
the world naked and defenseless. They didn't learn anything, and they didn't learn the stuff that they need with
which to have to de.al.with that literature. So, we have a double problem which is that there are certain things
that are worth knowing and worth learning, but they are usually very carefully hidden by the statisticians or
taught so badly that nobody learns it. So, then they go off into the literature, and all they can say is, 'Well,
reviewed by the Journal of Prestigious Medicine. So, it must be a good paper, and they have got prestigious
reviewers, even though they have published all the frauds of John Darcy and all of these other papers that turned
out to be wrong, it still must be good if it is in the Journal of Prestigious Medicine. So, I rely on their reviewers,
and I will be a nice decerebrate reader sort of like the doe in his office being brainwashed by the detail men:
DR. WYNDER: Now, we do not want to mislead you here to the fact that good epidemiology has and
will continue to make major contributions to our understanding of chronic disease_
DR. FEINSTEIN: Ernie, this is supposed to be for the audience. We have converted it into a dialogue
that is unfair.
DR. WYNDER: I know I just want to say this before we are misunderstood.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Sir?
DR. SCHEUPLEIN: Bob Scheupleiu, FDA. I would like to ask either of you a question. You said
that occasionally alchemy can result in a golden statue_ Lt me ask you what in your understanding of
meta-analysis, has a meta-analysis of the kind that we were describing here resulted in a finding that you wouldn't
have found some other way and can you give us an idea of how often that has happened?
DR. FEINSTEIN: Are you talking about a finding that was worth finding and that is valid or are you
just talking about --
141
566405690

DR. SCHEUPLEIN: Indeed, I am, yes.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I am sort of in the position of Dwight Eisenhower trying to find good things to say
about Richard Nixon.
0-auerhter.)
DR. FEINSTEIN: If you name something for me, I will try.
DR. SCHEUPLEIN: Give me a theoretical reason why it might, if there is one?
DR. FEINSTEIN: I understand that in the very next paper, if we give Dr. Friedman a chance to get
up here, that he is gals to point out how a meta-analysis helper] prove some things about tamoxifen that were
not available or apparent in the original studies, and we will see how that goes. That may very well have worked.
One last question, and then we really have to move on or I will have to castigate the Chairman.
DR. BERNARD: Bernard, SRA. Actually it is two comments. I think one, Bob, to answer your
question, I think it is very simple in terms of meta-analysis. As you compile more and more data, you get more
and more power to detect. Now, whether the detection is accurate, that is the problem, but you certainly can
detect more by incre-nsing the N.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Let me rephrase what you have said because you are using the word 'detect" which
I think is a misleading term here. As you get bigger and bigger numbers, you have more and more power to
magnify trivia. So, eve me the tiniest most trivial difference that you can possibly imagine, and then let me pick
a sample size big enough, and! will get craristical sigpificanee out of it. Archimedes made the remark, *If you
give me a lever that is long enough and strong enough, I will move the earth." You can take the most trivial
finding, and if you get a big enough sample size, you can magnify that into a P value below .05, so that what
happens as you accrue these more and more numbers of data, you can take tiny odds ratios and get them to be
significant. I think that is the point you were trying to make.
DR. BERNARD: What I am saying is that with increasing N you have more power to detect. What
the meaning of the difference is depends upon what you are measuring. Certainty the astronomers that take
thousands and hundreds of thousands of reading" in order to get orbits, etc., they are detecting minutia, but the
only way that they can do so is by taking hundreds of thousands of readings So, I don't think we want to get
into a discussion of what the meaning of the detection is.
The other thing I wanted to say was with regard to linear regression which I think was a very good point,
is that with linear regression it is set up so that you only have a certain number of variables, four, five, six, and
if you have to use all those variables it, of course, will explain all the data. It must. So, you can get very good
linear regressions and prove nothing. The key to that is to look at a number of different sets of data all using
the same factors and determine whether the linear regression is consistent across all those data sets, and that
kind of data you rarely ever see.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you.
We really need to go on. Our next speaker is Michael Friedman from the National Cancer institute who
is going to speak about The Tamoxifen Experience, and I think we are about to hear something positive on the
subject of meta-analysis.

THE TAMOXIFEN EXPERIENCE
Michael Friedman
National Cancer Institute, Maryland
DR FRIEDMAN: Thank you very muck I appreciate the opportunity to be here to address you. I,
myself, am not a statistician or epidemiologist but a clinical investigator. As I am sitting and listening to the
presentations this moraing. I am particularly grateful for the opportunity of doing something that I neva thought
I would do which is to be a modest proponent of meta-analysis. I certainly have had diqenseions, sometimes
animated discussions with Pitot, with Max Palmer, with others who have been very vigorous and articulate
advocates of meta-analysis as a statistical technique, and in those tihritcsions was somewhat critical, but I find
myself in the interesting position today of I guess pointing out what you all perceive anyway which is I think to
a certain extent some of the criticisms which we have heard leveled this morning are really criticisms of
individuals and not criticisms of techniques, that meta-analyses like other forms of data management, of scientific
insight are either well performed or poorly performed, but one doesn't blame the test. In this sense, I guess I
sound IBre a proponent of the National Rifle Association.
(Laughter.)
DR. FRIPMMAN: You know, tests really don't kill data. Bad investigators or poorly thought out
leaders of scientific inquiry kill data, and in this case, I never thought I would be saying that in public either
(Slide). Just a couple of words about breast cancer since I think it is essential that we talk about this disease
entity in order to understand what the analyses have purported to show.
What I have been asked to do this morning is to walk with you through some data that have been
published concerning a large nieta-analysis effort dealing with breast cancer, and many of you are quite
knowledgeable but some perhaps are not, and so, it is for those people that I asked for this couple of minutes
of introduction.
Breast cancer is a common disease in the United States. More than 160,000 women will be diagnosed
this year. More than 45,000 women will die. So, as a public health issue it is a supremely important one. It is
a disease, a set of diseases, I will maintain in a moment which predominantly affects older women so that 80
percent of all breast cancer cases are detected in women over the age of 50, and it is a clisease which in the
United States is detected relatively early, that is 80 percent of the patients have disease which is apparently
confined to the breast or to the breast and to the lymph nodes under the arm which drain that breast tissue.
In fad, there is a wealth now of both clinical and laboratory data which I think change our perspective
and rather than referring to breast cancer as a discrete disease, it is not a discrete biological entity. Rather it
is a set of related disnases sharing a common histologic picture having many features in common, but I think
demonstrating a remarkable biologic diversity.
Now, interestingly breast cancer today is almost archetypic, is a common epithelial cancer which is
incredibly well characterized from a biologic point of view. There have been enormous numbers of clinical
studies and laboratory studies devoted to understanding the basic biology and natural history of these diseases,
and it is probably the most extensively studied clinically worldwide.
This is the background against which we are looking at these diseases. Please recognize that the primary
treatment for breast cancer worldwide is for those women who have disease apparently confined to the breast
to somehow deal with that local problem, either by removing the breast Or removing, putt of the breast or
radiating the breast, but it is to excise or to eliminate the local disease, and at that time there is no apparent
566405632
143

disease anywhere else in the woman's body, but we know from studying hundreds of thousands of cases that
mazy of those women at some later date, a year, 5 years, 10 years even 20 years later go on to have recurrence
of their breast cancer and die of it.
Now, what that suggests is that hidden, occult, micrometa.static disease existed somewhere Within her
body at the time the breast as primarily dealt with. We are unable to detect those cells, but we arc quite sure
that those cells exist.
What do we know about characterizing breast cancer which leads us to be able to predict what will
happen to individual cases or to cohorts of women with breast cancer, and I will list for you only a few of the
large number of features which can be evaluated The reason why it is important to walk through this with you
just very briefly is I think the very cogent point that was made earlier that if one deals with a biologic set of data
that are homogeneous, certain conclusions are More easily drawn.
As soon as you begin to dissect that population, to demonstrate biologic diversity, the more complex the
analysis becomes, and what I hope to demonstrate for you is that breast cancer, although we think of it wrongly
as a single disease, in fact, is a myriad of diseases.
There are certain histopathologic features about breast cancer which distinguish those women who are
at good risk and those women who arc at poor risk of having a recurrence and dying, the nuclear grade of their
primary tumor, the differentiation of that tumor, whether or not she has rgional lymph node metasraces,
whether there is vascular invasion which has been demonstrated on the slide, and these are representative but
just randomly extracted data from many studies that could be looked at or that indicate that for disease-free
survival and overall survival those women who have poor nuclear grade have a far worse chance of either
remaining free of disease or surviving overall than do their cohorts who have good, well-differentiated histologic
grades or the chance of survival is dramatically better if one compares 64 percent and &I percent or 79 percent
and 93 percent.
These are numbers that not only have statistical difference but probably have important medical and
clinical difference as well.
There is a variety of laboratory phenomena which have been applied, some of these widely, such as sex
steroid hormone receptors, either the estrogen or the progesterone receptor, looking at DNA content, looking
at the fraction of cells which are actively engaged in replication, looking at the presence or absence of an
amplified oneogene which seems to be relevant for breast cancer or other genes or other proteins.
What we have then is the perception that for some kinds of breast cancer, for certain cohorts of breast
cancer cases, we do a remarkably good job of caring for them, and they are cured frequently, but that the
challenge is to more accurately discriminate amongst the many forms of breast cancer and excuse the spelling
there, probably Freudian although I am not sure how. There are subsets of patients that we treat and incorrectly
count amongs our triumphs. There are those patients that we treat ineffectively and don't retie that our
treatments will be ineffective until it is too late, and the patient has failed. The challenge is how to more
accurately describe patients with breast cancer and to tailor for them the proper therapies.
This is the first of two articles that I have been asked to discuss with you, published in the Laucet in
January of this year. It is a very large collaboration of breast cancer treatment specialists from all over the
world. Dr_ Pitot and his colleagues were responsible for much of the organization, much of the analysis, a great
deal of the quality assurance that went on.
A relatively large number of clinical studies all dealing with early breast cancer patients waa aggregated,
some 133 trials involving 75,000 women of whom 31,000 had suffered a recurrence and 24,000 had died, so that
what we have here is a largish number of patients.
1 44
56640%03

As was mentioned previously, these authors set out the following assumptions, first of all, that they
believed that modest differences in outcome arc medically important, and this was the question that I think was
being raised earlier.
If you are able to demonstrate Only a 5 percentage point improvement in a group that receives therapy
versus a group that doesn't receive therapy, is that 5 percentage point difference signficant? If you talk about
a disease as common as breast cancer, then the number of women involved tends to be relatively large, and
therefore, the outcome, public health, insuranee-wise, even to the individual, of course, might be relatively
significant, so that they argue, and I would certainly buy this argument that even modest differences in outcome
are medically relevant in talking about a dise_ase like breast cancer.
They sought to avoid the moderate random errors and biaces that were mentioned in the two previous
disaimions. How did they do that? They tried to restrict their activities only to those studies which they
considmed properly randomize'', and I will spend a moment more talking about that in a minute.
They looked for those studies that they considere4 to be proper methodologic studies. They tried to
include all studies, published and unpublished. They went about all over the world looking for data in a rather
vigorous net attempt and as was mentioned earlier, one of the most troublesome features of some papers that
are being published is the attempt to give significance to data dredging They set opt purposefully to minimize
data-derived subgroup analysis. They tried not to do that and said that they Would not construct artificially
comparisons in order to find statistically significant differences.
They would let biology dictate what was reasonable. They would use the studies as they were designed
and as the data were provided. Their methods were to look at all trials worldwide, published and unpublished,
properly randomized trials, and they were rather careful to go and analyze exactly how that was done.
Women with completely reseeted breast cancer and no apparent residual disease, the so-called "adjuvant'
group of patients and the patients must have been randomized prior to January 1, 1985, so that we had at least
5-year data at the time of this report and in some situations 10-year or longer data, moderately mature data for
a disease like breast cancer which often is a subacute or chronic disease process.
All the patients trials must have included at least one group in which a systemic adjuvant ti eatment was
applied, What do I mean by that? Well, the design to the studies was as follows: We are only Looking at the
tamoxifen studies. There are other studies of oophorectomy. There are other studies of chemotherapy which
we shall not deal with, but the tamoxifen studies all the patients had surgery. They were randomly allocated
either to receive tamoxifen for some period of time or either nothing or placebo, and this resulted in some 40
trials with almost 30,000 patients available for this kind of analysis.
The duration of therapy varied, and so, I have made the point to you that first of all the group of
patients is incredibly biologically diverse. So, you are talking about many, many kinda of ta east cancer. On top
of that, you are talking about many kinds of therapy administration. Only four trials had the tamoxilen Oven
for greater than a 5-year period of time. This was designed in the study. This was the protocol design.
Most of the trials had a 2-year administration dictated for the tamoxifen, in this, the largest group, some
15,00() women of whom 4000, almost 200 deaths had been noted and nearly 5700 recurrences had been noted.
So, you can see that depending upon what group you arc looking at, there were either larger or smaller subsets.
These are some of the data for recurrence. Now, as you recognize, there arc many effective ticatnients
for breast cancer so that even when a patient recurs, she may be treated with many kinds of therapy, and her
survival can be prolonged, so that the recurrence dots not quickly, necessarily translate into death, but it is a
terribly important end point.
If you look at those patients who receive tamoxifen and compare them to those patients who did lint,
you can see that there i a difference. At 10 years 5.1 percent of p:itients surviving flee of disease, versus 44.7
145
566405634

percent of the patients in the control group; this is a number which has a large number of zeroes in the
significance and the number of patients involved here is relatively large, but you recognize that was an insufficient
way to provide you that information, and you would c.halleng me and say, "Wait a minute, you just told me that
you cannot talk about breast cancer as simply taking the drug or not. Give me some of the important pathologic
features which we know segregate some groups of women into high risk and some groups into low risk: They
were unable to do this in this study, except for a very few factors, and this is one.
The presence of absence of axillary lymph nodes is a very important pathologic prognostic feature.
Those women who do not have lymph nodes involved survive much better as indicated by these two curves and
those women with positive axillary nodes, nodes involved with tumor have a worse relapse-free survival, but you
can see that there is an important difference of 33 percent versus almost 42 percent, and here 63 percent versus
68 percent. The size of the difference here is obviously smaller than for the worst prognosis group of patients.
This is actually how the data are displayed, and I bring this to you because the point has been made
earlier by both the previous speakers of some of these features. I will not try to define for you how they
constructed their odds ratios because I think Dr. Feinstein gave you enough of that information to permit you
to evaluate these.
This line here represents one, that is the null hypothesis that the treatment had no impact on the
outcome of the patients. Data to the left of this indicate a positive benefit for ttreatment. Data to the right
indicate that the patients had increased risk by taking the drug, in this case lartioxiferi
The size of these little squares represents the numbers of patients involved, and the confidence intervals,
the 99 percent confidence intervals are indicated by these horizontal bars, and quickly you can see that a very
tiny study, here is a study from I think Scandinavia with only 60 patients in each of the treatment groups, really
a tiny study. You can see that yes, it did seem to be positive, but the confidence intervals are so extreme that
you can say almost nothing about it. It exceeds the risk of two that Dr. Feinstein mentioned earlier. On the
other hand you have these ponderous blocks of nearly 1800, 2000 patients being treated_ The confidence is:aerials
here, of course, are much more restricted. The bulk of data is here. This is for recurrence.
Now, the question was asked, why do you need this sort of analysis, if each one of these trials seems to
be lying on this side of the line, and as a clinician they certainly seem to be lying toward the side of benefit to
me, why was it necessary to use this technique? The answer I think is in order to overcome the skepticism to
allow therapies to be widely applied one does whatever one needs to do, and in this case there were many
practitioners in Europe and in England who didn't believe any of these individual trials but were powerfully
persuaded by the data.
This is for different age grumps. The less than 50 premenopausal group you can see that there is very
little impact apparent from this analysis. For some of these other groups with tamoxifen there was a much
clearer impact as was described in those curves.
Now, this is a really interesting finding, and I want to spend just a moment on it because it reflects one
of the drawbacks that Dr_ Feinstein and Dr. Wynder made earlier. Iii these trials there is the arithmetic
summing of all the trials that included tamoxifen. So, sometimes it was tamoxifen versus nothing, but there were
some trials in which it was tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus chemotherapy, and for this group of women, the
younger women, the premenopausal women, and there we-re some, oh, I guess 8000 patients in this group, most
of the studies actually had chemotherapy in one arm with tamoxifen and tamoxifen in the other randomized arm.
Now, what that means is they were not able to show that chemotherapy, that tamoxifen was superior
to chemotherapy plus tamozifen_ No small wonder in that since chemotherapy is known to be effective in that
group of women, and so, if one constructs the comparisons illogically you will get data which will be confusing.
This does not mean that tamoxifen is ineffective. It means that the nature of their statistical protocol was such
that they could have overlooked a finding of some relevance. I hope I have not said that in a confusing way.
146
566405695

Let me quickly go on. More important than recurrence is survival. So, these are mortality data, the
same general curve that I showed you earlier for all women compared, and here there is a 6-percentage point
difference between those two groups, a very modest finding except when you think of the thousands of women
that it affects, it becomes more relevant. For the good and the poor risk groups a very intermting finding here.
If you recall, the shape of the curve for recurrences the difference at 5 years was roughly the same as the
difference at 10 years, that whatever benefit was manifest was manifest relatively early and was consistent.
Here it is quite interesting. Not only do the women begin to survive better, but as time goes on, the
survival actually improves so that at 10 years you have a more dramatic difference in survivorship than you do
at 5 years.
What are the explanations for that? There are many possible explanations, and these data won't tell
you them because as was pointed out by the two previous speakers, this is a relatively crude. sort of analysis. If
you ack me what I think might be. going on there, I think it is some positive effect of tanioxifen on something
besides breast cancer, and we have reason to believe that tamoxifen may be an importantly efficacious agent for
cardiovascular dse.ase in older women. If that is true, and what you are seeing is fewer breast cancer deaths,
you might, and I stress 'might" be seeing fewer cardiovascular deaths here, very interesting, and it needs to be
looked at.
These are the same sorts of data for survival, for mortality. You saW the data for recurrence was
strongly to this side. You note here that there is much more scatter for mortality, and this was one reason why
there was so much skepticism by some investigators that tamoxifen was actually usefuL
This is the subgroup analysis for survival, very similar to the data I showed you for recurrences. This
is for chemotherapy just to give you some comparison to show you that many of the studies had this same
phenomenon.
What conclusions then? I think Francis Bacon was right in this rept& I think that my own perception
of what we use meta-analyses for is only for very special kinds of situations, and that if they are properly
performed they can be enormously useful.
I think of meta-analyses as compasses, and that if you want to determine a direction, either for research
or for care, one does a meta-analysis, and it will give you a general heading of this is north, and this is south.
It is not a map. It will not tell you exactly how to get where you want to go, but if one needs a general direction,
then I think this may be a very useful technique.
I really appreciate the chance to talk to you_ Thank you.
(Applause.)

DISCUSSION
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Friedman_
This paper is open for comments and discussion.
Dr. Wynder?
DR.. WYNDER: I very much appreciate your wonderful talk. What you have as a COMMOD
denominator was biologically plausible relationship. We know tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen. We know tamoxifen
reduces the size of the ovary. So, we know in this case meta-analysis would work. The question I have, if you
look at your different end points in these studies, I noted that the data from Japan showed a particularly
important survival difference, and this, as you know, relates, in my opinion to the fact that Japanese, also, have
a low-fat diet, and I wonder whether you could comment on that and whether from your data you learned,
therefore, that there are certain points that will lead us to do future studies using other modalities like the one
that I am interested in on the low-fat diet?
DR. FRIEDMAN: I think it is a really important point because you quite rightly indicate that one
cannot derive data from this sort of analysis, but it does lead you to other hypotheses, and I think what you are
proposing is a very interesting hypothesis, and well worth exploring. I don't know currently, most of the studies
in Japan right now that I am aware of really are the more conventional sort using chemotherapy and hormonal
therapy. I don't know whether they are paying much attention to some of the dietary factors that you are
hypothesizing could be important.
I think that those sorts of studies arc going to be much more performed in the US and in Europe.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Dr_ Friedman, everything gets put into the form of those ratios. Now, if you have,
say a survival rate of I percent, and it is raised to 2 percent, the ratio is 2. If you have a survival rate of 30
percent, and it is raised to 60 percent, the ratio is still 2, but you have a much more impressive accomplishment.
One of the things that struck me as I looked at the data on the graphs which I gather Dr. Fitot prepared
to try to resemble a map of the London subway as much as possible, as I looked at those graphs, when you got
down to making certain comparisons, women who were lymph node positive and those who were negative, some
of those differences in recurrence rate, not survival rate were really quite small. They look big on the graph,
but it was about a, you know, a 2 percent direct increment, if you just subtracted the 2 over 10 years which "ain't*
all that impressive.
DR. FRIEDMAN: That is right.
DR. FEINSTEIN: And which might make you think if that is all thc benefit you are going to get, what
are the risks of the tamoxifen that you have to think about?
Now, I have heard someone who is not the kind of sweet, reverent pussy cat that I am make the cynical
remark that the reason they have pushed this taraoxifen so and the reason they have magnified basically trivial
accomplishments, such as very small increments in the actual recurrence rates is because there hasn't been all
that much progress made in breast cancer, and the institute wants to show they did something that appears to
be good.
DR. FRIEDMAN: I think that is a fair question. I guess I have three answers. The first is to restate
that this is a very crude compilation, and so, you had some studies that had drug given for less than a year, some
1 48
56640540'7

staclies where the drag was given for 2 rears and fewer studies where the drug was given for a longer period of
time. lots of data suggest that giving it for a longer period of time is much more effective, and so this —
DR. FEINSTEIN: Isn't it true that the longer you live, the hanger you live?
DR. FRIEDMAN No, no, no What I am talking about is comparisons of 5 years or 10 years or
tamoicifen versus a cohort of women who didn't receive that and are followed exactly in the same way. No, no,
Use are properly randomized studies where the intent is to give the drug for a longer period of time. The
differences there are more extreme, and so, what you arc doing here is obscuring important differences. I tried
to point that out with the chemotherapy plus hormonal treatment You are actually obscuring things by putting
it all together. That is the sense in which it is a compass giving you sortie crude assessment of which direction
you are going. It does not speak to the fine details of whether or not the proper dose was given or for the
proper period of time. It means that if you can show something here, it is so crude and so extreme that it nearly
must be true. So, that is No. L
No. 2 is I gness I would disagree with your assessment that these art small differences_ A 6 percentage
of 7 percentage point increase in survival, I suggest is very important
DR. FEINSTEIN Bat these arc not even survivors_
DR. FRIEDMAN: No, they arc, and we can go bade.
DR.. FEINSTEIN: They were rearrrentats.
DR FREEDMAN: No, no, we can go back, and I can show you. The second set of tables, the second
set of graphs I showed were survivorship, and the differences there were really 6, 7, 8 percentage point
differences for some subgroups. That is important for a disease like this.
The third point I think is the mast important which is I think that is the., having given you that answer,
that is not the right answer to give_ The right answer to give is what we need to do is to understand what is
peculiar about those subgroups because what we are doing, and I know you understand this, and I don't mean
to be cynical in some way, we are curing 100 percent of certain populations, and if we can characterize those
populations, then we won't expose the women who aren't going to benefit to the till:166es of this treatment Your
point is well made. We will apply the treatment to those women who are most likely to benefit, and we will then
go on to look for other treatments for those groups who are proving refractory to this therapy. That I think is
the key of this_ It is really a gokl mine, and what we need to do is to snine out what arc the subgoncs of vaimen
who benefit particularly?
DR. FEINSTON: Other questions or comments? Dr. Shubik?
DL SFLUBIK: Dr_ Friedman, I wonder if you could say a word or two about the question of adverse
effects versus beneficial effects of tamoxifen, and bow it happens that as far as I understand it on die basis of
this meta-analysis use is plunging onwards with the possible use of tarn oxifen as a chrmopreventive agent in
normal women?
DR. FRIEDMAN: Certainly I will try to do that.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Not too king an answer, Mike_
DR. FREEDMAN: Okay, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
DR. FEINSTELN: With that superb response, eloquent and accurate, we thank Dr. Friedman for his
presentation, and we will go on to the next paper by Paul Switrer of Stanford University on the Environmental
Tobacco Smoke Experience.

Paul Switzer
Stanford University, California
PROF. SWTTZER: The previous speakers prefaced their remarks by saying, "I am not a statistician,
but..." and I will start by sayingg, I am a statistician, but...." I am going to talk about the environmental tobacco
smoke experience. My presentation was made especially simple by the fact that about a month ago the
Environmental Protection Agency released a draft review entitled Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking,
Lung Cancer and Other Disorders. This is a draft written for their Scientific Advisory Board. A meeting of the
Scientific Advisory Board will take place next week to review this draft.
This is the second such draft. The first draft was submitted a year and one-half ago and was criticized
then by myself and othcrs, as well as the Scientific Advisory Board. The SAD, nevertheless, seemed to accept
the conclusions. This is their second shot. What I will do mainly today is to describe and criticize what is
contained in their report. It is a report of some 500 pages. The principal arguments that are made in this report
for associations between environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer arc based on epidemiological studies.
I will show you the results of those studies and how they were synthesized, and I will offer some criticisms.
You will see many numbers here because there arc many numbers to Om- w. Table 1 shows estimates
of relative risk, for lung cancer. All of these studies arc spousal studies, that is they compare non-smoking
women married to smokers with non-smoking women married to non-smokers. The relative risk refers to the
relative risk for those two exposure groups. The relative risk numbers here arc typically 1.5. These are the kinds
of small numbers that we have been cautioned against for good reason earlier this morning.
Also shown axe 90 percent confidence intervals for relative risk should point out that the first draft
of this report used 93 percent confidence intervals. They have now gone to 943 percent confidence intervals. Dr.
Feinsteizi made the point earlier that with 80 percent confidence intervals you would get eNen shorter intervals.
You could do what you wdsat by adjusting the confidence level. Nevertheless, they seem to have a reason for
doing this.
There was a question regarding the interpretation of these confidence intervals. They Lan be given the
following interpretation. The outcome associated with an individual in a study is like a (sap shoot. For example,
each individual in first exposure group might have a I in 10,000 chance of getting lung cancer, while those in the
second exposure group each have 1 in 15,000 chance. The outcomes are not connected with one another; that
is, they are statistically independent by assumption, and the individuals within a group are all assumed to have
the same probabilities, also by assumption.
These confidence intervals represent the randomness associated with rolling of dice. If you have the
same number of individuals in the study, and you roll the dice again, with the same risk numbers, then you would
sec different outcomes. With repetitions of the sante study 90 percent of the time, the observed relative risk
would fall between the upper and lower confidence limits.
By the way, the EPA Draft says "Do not quote or cite.' However, it has been released for public
comment so I am not sure what the "Do not quote or site" means. I will be quoting e.xtensively. There are some
rather large studies here. The Williams' study with narrow confidence limits sugge.sts that environmental tobacco
smoke may he protrctive The most recent study is a US study by Fontham et at., which I will come back to later.
Another large study is the one by Hirayama which played an important role in earlier lepoits by the Surgeon
General and the Natioual Academy of Sciences on environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer. By the way,
these is a long list of footnotes in which they warn you about some of the problems with individual studies and
how they differ from one another. They Lertainly are a heterogeneous bunch of studies. -

The next thing I want to show you is another table from the EPA draft report_ This table (see Table
2) shows the results of a meta-analysis. It shows relative weights assigned to individual studies. Furthermore,
the studies are divided into geographic regions. Studies art combined to form a single estimate of relative risk
using the indicated weights. Where do these weights COMC from? Basically they are tied to the sizes of the
studies with larger studies getting more weight than smaller studies. Technically it COCOS% directly from the width
of the ecafidence intervals. If the confidence interval is wide, that study gets small arvight_ If it is narrow, it gets
larger weight.
Also, the power calculations for individual stuck: shown in Table 2 just reflect of the size of the study.
These numbers axe probabilities, and they give the proba.bility that a relative risk of L5 would be detected under
the same assumptions used to construct the confidence intervals. "Detected* means that the 90% confidence
interval would not include the value LO. So, we would be led to reject the 'null' hypothesis in the ease where
the real underlying relative risk were 1.5. These are just another measure of the size of the study.
The meta-analysis of the US studies was then propagated to population risk calculations. Dr. Friedman
indicated at the conclusion of his tall that a meta-analysis is like a compass which points in a certain direction
rather than a map. However, this meta-analysis was used for much more.
The narrow confidence interval derived from the meta-analysis was used to limit the uncertainty in population
risk estimates.
The overall relative risk derived from the meta-analysis of US studies is 1.19. The lower 90% confidence
limit is fairly close to LO. If you took a 95 or 99 percent confidence limit, this would actually start to push below
1.0. It is this meta-analysis of the US studies which forms the principal basis tor the conclusions in the EPA
report.
It is interesting that risk estimates come out rather differently fin diffetent regions. While the studies
within regions are also heterogeneous, certainly you can see clear differences between regions.
For the China region the draft report omitted the largest study because the authors felt there was some
problem with confounding. The omitted study is the Wu-Williams' study which was the largest of all the studies
and had a negative result. This omission is an example of the iallmitance of selecting studies for the
meta-analysi.s. It has a very substantial effect, as you sec in Table 2.
In Table 3 we see calculated dose-response trends. What you see arc relative risks for different exposure
levels. The exposure levels are based on the cigarette consumption of the husband. The claim is made that
there is a consistent dose response relationship. However, if you look at Table 3 carefully, it is certainly not a
consistent relationship 1:), any means
The significance levels calculated for thc dose-response trends are wrong because they use the baseline
exposure level as an exposure category fox this purpose. This adds a spurious "level,- the effect of which is to
create spuriously significant values for the trend.
Table 4 shows the d.raft report's population risk calculations. They took t be re a.Llts of the meta-analysis
for US the spousal smoking studies and calculated lung lancer mortality estimates For non-smoking women
married to smokers, the number is 470 annual lung cancer deaths attributed to ETS We will talk about the
uncertainty in a minute.
The other estimates of attributable population I.CDs all come [rim: thit our:. number together with
assumptions regarding 'background' ETS exposure. Women marned to non-smokers are assumed to be exposed
to ETS in other places Both the control group, as well as the t-ases have. IS cyosure. There is an attempt
to male a risk caltadatiou for the control group relative to a Uuly unexposed population, a very difficult thing
to do. The way it was done was to look at cotinine concentrations in arinc or bloo.d for those who are exposed
to spousal ETS and those who are not exposed to spousal LTS. (.01unne can Is: present r;:gaidless of the
reported exposure 01 tn,Jisaluals Even individuals who rep. n t no EM c vp(.sti cc comm. rrli show positive. cotinine

concentrations. Nevertheless, the report infers a typical exposure ratio for causes versus controls. It the,
calculates lung cancer mortality at background exposure levels by extrapolating a dose-response function_ So,
there are siren assumptions that go into these population risk numbers. You will notice a lot of these numbers
are much bigger than the spousal ETS exposure population risk_ The special number, 470, is highly leveraged
to get a number which in the total comes out to be something like 3000 LCD's annually attributable to ETS.
I would like to address the question of bias which was addressed earlier at this meeting. The target
population for risk assessment is about the US population. The study populations are not the same as the target
population, and there may well be systematic differences. This is one of the major potential sources of bias_
Another source of bias is the selection for inclusion of studies in a meta-analysis_ Furthermore, we need to
worry about abandoned and unreported studies. There is also a 'consensus' bias, that is study results in
agreement with previously published results are more likely to see the light of day.
There are publication biases of other kinds, for example, early reporting of uncompleted studies. The
large Fontbam study which I alluded to earlier, a USA study, is not complete, but its results were nevertheless,
published in preljrnirmry form. It is a positive study, and one wonders whether the same study would have been
reported in its =completed form if the results were negative_ Similarly there is a suggestion that another large
study with negative findings is coming out very slowly.
We have also the problem of selective adjustment of studies_ Corrections and adjustments are always
made to studies_ They can be made in different ways with the potential for 'a high level of selection.
Furthermore, we must be aware of the purposive and selective level of detail of reporting.
Finally, we must ask whether it is fruitful to pursue small relative risks? In the light of so many
difficulties, the pursuit of small relative risks, such as 010SC sometimes claimed for ETS, may not be froiduL It
would be much better to try to isolate susceptible populations with very high exposures. There we may sec larger
and sustainable relative risk numbers_

DISCUSSION
DR FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Switzer. You have told us about all of the various trees that are
involved. What would be your bottom line about the forest, if I were a congressman or a congress person and
I came to you and said, 'What derision do I make here? Here is this L19, and it is statistically significant. Do
I conclude that environmental tobacco smoke is dangerous, yes or no?"
PROF. SWrfZER: No, not on the basis of the epidemiological data. I don't believe it is statistically
significant, by the way. I am showing you what the EPA's analysis came up with.
DR. FEINSTEIN: And as someone who has critically reviewed that EPA thing your conclusion is that
it is to be believed or not to be believed?
PROF. SWITZER: Its conclusion is not to be believed, and I should point out that the statistical
sficznce, the way in which the confidence interval for meta-analysis is calculated provides a spurious precision
because the confidence interval for the meta-analyzed final number, this narrow confidence interval treats the
individual studies as though they were randomly selected data from the target population. It does not treat the
individual studies as observational data which they really are. They arc studies of opportunity in some sense.
They are data of opportunity, and as you pointed out in your earlier remarks, even if they were randomized
clinical trials, when you put them together they become data of opportunity and should be analyzed as
observational data, and therefore, the method for calculating the confidence limits is optimistic.
PROF. SMITH: Robert Smith, London. Does the report deal with other respiratory diseases such as
asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and if so, what sort of relationships are claimed there?
PROP. SWTTZER: It deals with other respiratory problems only in children, and I have not looked at
that part of the report carefully. I concentrated on the lung cancer. I believe they claim some positive findings
DR. ADAMSON: Adamson, NCI. I think you need to take into account when responding to the
question with regards to ETS the totality of the diseases, including childhood diseases which Dr. Smith has asked
the question about. Is environmental tobacco smoke good or bad for you or has no effect? I think if you take
into account the totality of the diseases, including childhood diseases, the answer will be it is bad for you.
PROF. SWITZ.ER: I don't think the report was written basically to provide documentation for the
classification of environmental tobacco smoke as a classic carcinogen. That was the reason for producing the
report, and I don't think the issue I am addressing here is whether the evidence, the epidemiological evidence
is sufficient to come to that conclusion. ETS may be bad for you for lots of reasons. It smells had. It may make
some people sick and so forth, but I think the important thing is to try to identify what sorts of people are made
sick by it and in what doses.
MR. DESKIN: Deskin, Cyanamid. I am wondering if there arc some other variables that were looked
at, for example, is ETS in the US the same as El's in China or Japan? Are cigarettes the same? Was that
analysis looked at? Are there other factors that might be involved in the composition of F.TS? Ha.s that been
looked at?
PROF. SWITZER: I will no longer be speaking as a statistician, if I try to answer your question. The
studies, of course, are heterogeneous in many ways. Cigarettes arc different to some extent. I don't know, and
the exposure is likely to be different in different oyint ries. People may, women many spend more time at home
in China than they do in the US. So, the effect of spousal exposure may be greater in China than the US. There
was some discussion, of course, on this point, and when people tried to, some of the people tried to calculate.
back out of this background exposure, non-spousal exposure in order to assign population risk numbers to people
who are not spousally exposed, there were considerations of this kind, certainly.
5664105708

DR. FEINSTELNI: One last question_
DR. HALL: Dick Hall, Baltimore. Is cotenine a metabolite tmique to nicotine or is it a metabolite of
other substances perhaps of dietary origin?
PROF. SWITZER: Again, I won't be gpraking as a statistician when I answer this question.
DR FEINSTEIN: Do you want an informed consent for you to speak as a non-statistician?
(Laughter-)
PROF. SWITZER: Since non-statisticians are speaking as statisticians, I feel that permission is impficit.
(1-zaghtzr-)
PROF. SWITZER; I think you wilt probably hear different views on this point. What surprised me just
looking at the data is the fact that cotenine seemed to be present in most samples taken, regardless of reported
exposure, as I mentioned earlier which would indicate to me that it is not unique to nirotIni-, and for this reason,
that when one calculates, tries to back out an exposure levr../ for so-called "the unexposed population,' one needs
to take into consideration that there may be some kind of background cotenine, and if that is not taken account
of it greatly exaggerates the effe:cts of background exposure.
DL PEDISTEM It is time for a toffee break.
Dr. Shubik, we arc running about 20 minutes late. Do you want to try to shorten the coffee break or
shall we just proceed with our 20-minute lateness? Okay, we were due to return here at 10:35 a.m. Why don't
we return here at 11145 a.m.
(Brief recess.)
DR. FEITIMIN: We will resume the session. Our next speaker is Leeka Klieifets of the Electric
Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, California who will speak on Electric and Magnetic Fields - Evidence to
Date.
Dr. Khcifets?

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS - EVIDENCE TO DATE
Leeka Kheifets
Electric Power Research Institute, California
DR. ICHEIFETS: I will talk, today about electromagnetic field exposure and its potential as a
carcinogenic agent_ The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from ionizing radiation, which is a known carcinogen,
to high frequency fields, such as microwaves which do not seem to be carcinogenic to a new potential hazard:
power frequency electromagnetic fields. So we arc talking about Low-frequency, low-energy fields.
In this presentation I would like to present the relevant epidemiologic research and meta-analysis and
then to summarize the scientific evidence to date. Although some biological effects have been demonstrated on
the cellular level and potentially in laboratory animals, magnetic fields are not considered mutagenic. If there
is a relationship between magnetic fields and cancer, it is likely that magnetic fields function as a promotion or
a co-promoter. Additionally, the evidence suggests that if there is a carcinogenic effect, it is a small one.
Overall, the association with cancer remains questionable.
The epidenniologic &astute in this area is fairly broad_ There arc over 60 original studies, the number
of reviews, however, is beginning to rival the number of original investigations. There are over 15 literature
reviews and five meta-analyses which provide me with an opportunity to do a meta-analysis of meta-analysis.
There are basically two types of epidernitilogic investigations in this field: residential and occupational_
Residential studies of EMF and adult cancer have generally produced negative results, and I won't go into them
in detail. I will, however, elaborate on the studies of childhood cancer as it correlates with residential EMF
exposure. With respect to the occupational EMF studies, I will focus on leukemia and brain cancer.
Concern about magnetic field exposures was initiated in 1979 study by Wettheimer and Leeper. They
performed a ease. control study of childhood cancer in the Denver area using proximity to and characteristics of
power lines as a surrogate for exposure to magnetic fields. This study found a large and significant excess of
risk associated with wiring configuration. The resultant odds ratio was on the order of the three.
It is from this study that the exposure assessment method, known as 'wire code," originated. Specifically,
it is derived from the thickness of power line wires running near to the home together with the distance of the
home to the wires. Essentially, it is a visual assessment that attempts to predict magnetic field exposure in the
home. Magnetic fields arc, in fact, extremely variable. They are present in most eriviionments and come from
many different sources The issue has been raised that this particular exposure categorization focuses solely on
one source of exposure, namely distribution and transmission of power hues and ignores other potentially
important sources. Hu thermore, assigning a wire code classification is not an easy task Looking at these slides,
one represents a very high exposure category, the other a very low one A distinction that is not always easy to
make.
Nevertheless, when this study was replicate"! in 1988 by David Savaz, again in Denver, the observation
of association between childhood cancer and wile codes was confirmed. Although the tune period for case
ascertainment and foltow-up differed from those in the original study, his Jesuits were consistent. Savitz
expanded the assessment of exposure. by taking actual field measurements wit tun the burnt.% Unfortunately, these
"spot' meastirementc did not prove to be useful_ In tact, the a.csoclotion witri ,dual measurements was much
weaker than that with wiring configuration.
The neat slide demonstrates the predictive value of v.ire code,' compared to the actual spot
measurement of 1713r,iietiC fields. I have presented the basic distribution: mean, tnedian and range rat each.

DISCUSSION
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Kheifets.
Comments, questions?
Let me ask you one while people are getting some together? In my adventures in looking over the
public health world or epidemiologie case-controlled studies, they have a broad range of scientific quality,
extending from poor to atrocious, and when you look at these, do you and your colleagues attempt to make any
adjustments or scoring or preferential evaluations for those studies that are merely poor in contrast to those that
are really atrocious?
DR. ICHEIFETS: Yes, I mentioned that one of the latest meta-analyses tried to --
DR. FEINSTEIN: No, I don't mean the meta-analysis. I mean the studies that you look at as the
elements that get pooled into the meta-analysis.
DR. ICKEIPEI.S: That is what I mean, that one of the meta-analyses .tried to separate so-called
*preferred" studies from all the other studies, and provided the estimates of just preferred studies and all the
studies combined, and they were really quite similar although clearly in this literature there is a wide range of
studies, and the thought always has been by epidemiologists that this area was begun with quite poor storm&
They were done with small resources that were more hypothesis generating, were more maybe data dredging
or, you know, were done not in a blinded fashion, let us say, as far as the exposure coding goes, and with the
better studies everybody thought that the picture would become much clearer, and I think, in fact, that has not
happened. I think the studies have become better in many ways. They have become better in terms of exposure
assessment and in terms of design and in terms of quality control. Nevertheless, the picture did not, I think the
association went down maybe a little bit, but the picture remained pretty much the same, 1 think.
DR. FEJNSTEIN: Sir?
DR. VINCENT: Vincent, James River. Do you believe that these studies would have shown the
association if this were a developmental or reproductive effect?
DR. ICIIEIFETS: I didn't go into that literature because there are a lot fewer studies in that, and the
animal literature there is clearly negative as far as developmental effect, but there are some dues that there
might be influence on the fetal development, and there arc two studies, large studies that are now under way
that are going to look at both miscarriages, time to pregnancy, fetal growth and other parameters with respect
to exposure to EMF, but at this point there are very few studies that have looked at that in a very careful way.
DR_ VINCENT: I was thinking of the leukemia incidence, if that could have happened.
DR_ ICHEIFETS: Oh, certainly, I mean certainly the time, the pregnancy is a very important time
period potentially, and some of the studies or some. of the invesiigators, at lease think that they see a stronger
effect with the later exposure. So, the exposure not during the fetal development, but let us say, 2 years prior
to diagnosis, but I think that, you know, the pregnancy time is the very important time factor. Of course, it is
further back in time, and so, asc,eitaiuly exposure is more difficult, but that is being looked at.
DR. FEINS IhIN: You were mea.
DR. LE VOIS: Maury LeVois of the Institute for Evaluating Health Risk. I wanted to ask you a
question. It seems to me that both this set of epidemiologic studies and the one that Dr. Switzer was talking
170 5664051-11.5

about share some things in common. They use a proxy for exposure. You really are not measuring exposure.
You are measuring some things that seem reatetoable, at least on their face to stand for exposure. I think even
in the case where you have in-the-house meaStires of electromagnetic fields for 24 hours, it is still a proxy for
the meaningful exposure at some time earlier in history, and I am wondering if it isn't also a proxy for a variety
of other things, and I was wondering if you could comment on how well these studies have looked at, well,
preface it with one more comment. I understand that at least in some of these studies they got the idea that,
well, these power lines run down busy streets, and perhaps we should take a look at traffic density, and they
found that traffic density predicted just as well as the wiring code. However, when you adjusted for traffic
density, it didn't remove the effect of wiring code because it was a different set of outcomes that were predicted_
I wonder how many other things might go along with this wiring code, the number of appliancrs, the
size of the household, number of rooms, number of children and a variety of things that either could be
socioeconomic mediated types of variables and how far along they are in really understanding what these
measures that you have even on a 24-hour basis might, also, be proxies for, in other words what confounders
might exist?
DR.. KHEIFETS: I think that there are several aspects that could be emphasized. As far as
confounding goes, we know very little about childhood cancers. We don't have strong predictors that we know
that we have to control for.
The later studies, as I mentioned, have tried to look at as many variables basically as they could think
of, and some of them to a better or lesser degree, they all try to control for all the potential confounding. They
have done it with different degrees of sueeecc, I think,
I think the traffic density is one of the things that, again, was looked at and didn't prove to be creating
this association. Maybe it is or it is not an actual predictor of risk, but it doesn't seem to be predicting this
association_
I didn't, also, go into the fact that some of the studies, also, show some as.sociation with electrical
appliances, but, again, there it is based just on the questionnaire. it is a very, very, you know, much cruder
assessment in general, and as fax as, it is true that all of the studies are retrospective in nature, and it is very
difficult to do a study or at least nobody has bcen able to come up with a way to do a study that would look at
the very rare high exposure such as this one is and the very rare disease, and therefore, all of the studies are
retrospective, but even if there was a prospective study, such as with pregnancy outcomes we are doing a
prospective study, but even there we don't know what to. measure, and that is the problem.
So, even if we are measuring today, this minute, the possibilities are enormous, and I have to narrow
and say that okay, I am betting on time-weighted average, arid that is what has been happening., and it didn't pay
off.
So now, we have to go into different directions and try to see what might potentially pay off, hut we just
don't know what to measure.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Dr. Cori?
DR. GORI: We have heard that the EPA is proceeding against ETS, the basis of data and odds ratio
or values that are even lower than what we have for EM I- here. I understand that in the issue of EMF, EPA has
decided that the epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to warrant any action, at least up to now. Is there any
movement to change that particular view at the EPA level?
DR. KTIEIFETS: No, I don't think so. I think that they have decided not to rank it in terms of the,
as a potential carcinogen on their scale, partly becau.se the animal evidence is totally lacking at this point, not
that it is negative., but it is just coming out There is a lot of cellular studies, hut they are not good long-term
animal studies, and I think that the other aspect is that what is happenina at least in the cellular type of
1/1566405716

literature is that the effects don't seem to be linear or even sort of dose-response type, and there seem to be
windows or some strange phenomenon, and so, it is unclear what do you do, whether you should reduce fields,
increase them or modify them.
DR. FEINSTEIN: One last question. I do want to point out there is a panel discussion after all the
speakers are finished, so that if any of you have questions that you haven't had a chance to get through so far,
you will have another chance later to have at them, once we have let them all get a chance to have at us.
Sir?
DR. FIELDER: Thank you, Chairman.. Robin Fielder, Department of Health, London. One quick
comment about confounding factors in childhood leukemia. We have been very involved particularly in childhood
leukemia around power statioas and meat processing plants. There are a number of factors that are recognized
like the inverse relationship to socioeconomic class. I think it would be very important to cover for things like
that.
My question is several people have talked about biological plausibility. Are there any rational biologic
explanations as to why a magnetic field may be carcinogenic?
DR. ICKELFETS: Two comments, again. One is that in fact, I agree with oti, there is some gradient
potentially with childhood leukemia SE& It is very slight, and it would be going in the opposite direction from
-- so, it would be obscuring the risk here rather than creating the risk because the wire codes probably tend to
be higher. These wiring configurations tend to be in poorer neighborhoods. So, that probably would not explain
this association.
As far as the biological possibility, I think that that has changed a lot. I think that 3 or 4 years ago most
people considered this to be biologically implausible, and I think now there arc several models, none of them
confirmed or none of them well researched, but there are several possibilities as to who this has been happening.
There is definitely some effect seen in cells. What is their relevance to carcinogenesis is unclear, but there are
some fairly robust changes.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, I)r_ Kheifets.
In my own adventures in the world of public health evangelism, anything is biologically plausible as a
carcinogen if it is A, an advance beyond the era of the noble savage, B, made by a profit-making company. In
either of those circumstances it is instantly suspect as a carcinogen.

THE LEAD EXPERIENCE
Claire B. Emhart
Case Western Reserve University, Ohio
Last year I visited a little museum in Scotbod in which the evidence for the existence of the Loch Ness
Monster was exhibited_ As I walked through the dispbys I was struck by the parallel with lead-effects research:
"A sighting" of the Monster is actually often something else - a log or a change in current, for example.
There is little consistency among the sightings - what it looks like, how big it is, how it behaves, and so
forth.
But it's hard to prove that the Monster doesn't exist.
Background
Contrary to what is reported in the media, there is no epidemic of childhood lead poisoning. The notion
of epidemic is being promoted by the activist group, Environmental Defense Fund (BOG), (1) among others.
An indication of the distortion in this report is seen in results for one community, greater Seattle. EDG stated
that some 40% of the toddlers in Seattle have blood lead levels (PbB) greater than the -worry level," of 10
addL However, a retrospeective survey of pediatric practitioners and the area's five largest clinical laboratories
identified no children with PbB > 20 ag/di and only 3% with PbB .> 10 ag/do.(2)
The idea of "epidemic" is based on a redefinition of lead poisoning. This redefinition does not depend
on mortality and morbidity data; it is based on a conclusion that there is a loss of cognitive and, hence, academic
ability due to low level lead exposure.
If there is such an effect it must be weak Highly consistent evidence from a number of surveys (Fig.1)
shows that PbB levels have dropped dramatically in the past several decades. There is, however, no evidence
that the academic performance of children has improved in this time span
I will return shortly to the analogy with the Loch Ness Monster. First, though, it might help to describe
some of the basic, generally recognized, parameters of research on the topic Some of this material will also be
relevant to the problems involved in lead-effects litignion involved in lead-effects litigation.
Populations affects
Aside from occupational exposure, the segments of the lifespan that are of greatest concern arc the fetal
period and the period from about 18 to 30 months. Blood lead levels in children tend to peak at about 24
months. Floor and dirt play and the mouthing of objects and hands, contribute to increased ingestion.
Effects, or Outcome Measures
The effect or outcome that causes the greatest concern is a possible loss of cognitive ability (intelligence,
language, academic achievement, etc.). It would be helpful to be able to evaluate the effect of lead shortly after
the time of exposure so that other factors are less likely to mask an effect. As noted above, however, our
greatest concern is for the infancy and 'oddity periods Some tests of "cognitive.' or at least neurological
functions can be used from earliest infaney These eijtv incasuree are poor predictors of school age performance
for all except the seveiely impanel
56640571S

One solution is to use a prospective or longitudinal plan in which a cohort of children is followed over
time. Well look at the results of some prospective studies shortly.
Psychometric measurement does not have the precision that characterizes measures of some outcomes.
Even with well standardized, properly administered tests, variations of 5 points or more between two times of
testing or two different tests are not unusual. The effect of measurement error is to reduce the likelihood of
finding an effect, given there is one.
Measurement of Lead Exposure
'Lead exposure* refers to a biochemical index that reflects exposure. There is no non-invasive index that
measures total body burden or lead level in the central nervous system. The index used most widely is blood
lead level (PbB). PbB is a relatively transitory index. We seldom have a history of exposure and we don't know
whether a given reading is a peak or valley reading for the lifetime of the child.
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) reflects a response of blood to lead. It is poorly related to PbB at low
exposure levels. The use of shed deciduous (baby) teeth, which presumably measures exposure over time, is
experimental since results can vary greatly depending on the location and portion of the tooth analyzed.
Concordance among repeated measures of either blood lead or dentine lead is limited. This means that
we are seeking our Monster through murky water.
The Issue of Confounding
Is our Monster actually something else? This, the problem of confounding of possible lead effects with
other factor; has been recognized for some time. The situation can he complicated. If an extraneous variable
is either a consequence of or a cause of the risk factor, it should not be included. We are sometimes uncertain
of the temporal or logical order of events that bear on an inference of causality. As with so many
methodological issues, this one becomes more complex the more one works on it_ A colleague and I have
written a relatively non-technical paper on these issues (3).
The confounders that are generally most important in lead-effects work are hoe; elated. These include:
parental intelligence and education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, number of siblings, single parent household,
lack of prenatal rare, and childhood illness ( including severe otitis media). These variables are often
undermeasured For example, we may settle for a quick and easy test of materna iotelliVence and we usually
skip the father altogether. Error of measurement in a confounder dilutes the dfcreiveoe-ss of the measure-
Undermeasurement due to measurement error or to omission means that we undercontrol for that influence.
Poor nutrition is a variable that is likely to be a confounder, but which we have generally ignored
One of the most important confounding attributes is the quality of the caretaking environment. The
instrument we've used, called the HOME Inventory, taps the responsivity of the parent (or other caregiver) to
the child and the kind of stimulation provided in the home. Example: *Mother 'talks' to the child while doing
her work
In most of the studies in which they have been included, the HOME Inventory and parent IQ, with
which it is correlated, are the two variables that are most strongly related to the cognitive outcome measures.
They are powerful confounders because they are related to lead exposure as well as to cognitive measures.
Most investigators acknowledge that control of confounding is necessary and that presenting results that
are not adjusted for confounding is misleading. We'll look now at some of what w.is used as the basis for the
wide-sweeping - and expensive - recommendations in the October 1991 CDC Document, Preventing Lead
Poisoning in Young Children.
174
566405719

Figure 2, copies from the CDC Document (p. 10) provides intelligence test data from seven studies.
The text of the document states that in most eases [the IQ scores] were adjusted for potential confounding
factors." As we read the original articles, however, we find that:
• The Fulton et aL (1987) study did include reasonable adjustment for confounding, but the original had
10 data points; the method and reason for converting them to these smoother looking three points is
unclear.
• The WHO/CEC Multicenter (Winneke et aL, 1990) study had very limited adjustment for confounding.
This an interesting study. I'll come back to it shortly.
The Lansdown et al (1986) study of manual and non-manual (socioeconomic) groups included no
adjustment for confounding. The results were not statistically sficant, even without adjustment.
The Yule a aL (1981) study. Yule stated quite clearly that only social class was adjusted and that other
confounders affected the results of this study.
The Schroeder et aL (1985) study. These data were not adjusted for'confounding.
The Hawk et aL (1986) study. These data were not adjusted for confounding. When the investigators
did adjust the results for confounding the dramatic decrease in scores was markedly attenuated and not
statistically significant.
These results were cited to support the hypothesis 'that decrements in children's cognition are evident
at blood lead levels well below 25 ag/d1," and "No threshold for the lead-IQ relationship is discernable from
these data." Since most of these studies did not or would not have an effect size large enough to reach statistical
significance with control of confounding, they could not have detected a threshold.
The WHO/CEC study (4) of 1879 children examined at eight centers in Europe is enlig,htening with
respect to the appearance of an effect below 10 ag/tIL The results by eento cue shown in Figure 3. Obviously
test scores differ quite notably by ceoter. Some centers did not have enough cases with lead levels below 10
ag/d1 (1.0 on the log scale) to plot points. The plots with values below 10 sig/d1 were horn communities with
generally high IQ scores. If we compared the mean IQ from these four centers with the mean IQs related to
lead levels at 10 ag/d1 or higher, with all groups included, we would see what looks like highet IQ associated
with lead levels below 10 ag/d1. This apparent effect is due to confounding. With statistical control of the
differences due to centers, there was no significant lead effect, even though other confounders were poorly
controlled and the sample size was ample for the detection of a small effect. The effect for Group I, when it
was considered independently from the rest, did reach staosticat significance. The plot for this center, however,
shows that the lowest mean IQ score is obtained by the children with the lowest lead level and that 10 increases
as lead increases to about 25 agicil.
There is another graph in the CDC document that is startling. We'll look at its predecessor, (5) shown
in Figure 4. This is a contrast of the cumulative frequencies of 10 scores for high and low lead groups. The
point of the contrast is that lead decreases IQ through the full range of IQ scores. These data were not adjusted
for confounding. This graph has been widely lepiOdUCed Ill a number of tepoits.
But this graph has recently changed its shape! Figure 5 is reproduced horn the CDC Document. The
graph is now smoothers. Furthermore, new high-lead, low-IQ cases have been added at the bottom left. This
makes it possible to report that I0s below /5 sic three times as pievalent in high lead children as in low lead
children. Using the earlier version of the graph 1 fpireci the ratio at 1.7:i instead of 301 (Footnote 1)
So what can we say about confounding? It can he difficult to untancle in a Liven study. Even so, much
of wbat has been attributed to lead, in the CDC iqiort :Ind elsewhere, is probabh, due to other, iincontiolled
conditions
566405720

To return to our analogy, there's a lot going on in these waters. Whether any of it is indicative of our
Monster is problematic let's look at the consistency among sightings.
Consistency, the Prospective Studies
Consistency within and between studies is easier to assess when the studies are similar in design and,
of course, when the effect of confounding is reasonably well controlled_ The prospective studies meet these
criteria. We'll start by steonmarizing the basic design of these studies. Using this design we have been able to
accrue massive amounts of data
Five prospective studies, conducted in Boston, Cincinnati, Ciewiand, Pt. Pine (Australia) and Sydney
(Australia), have now reported data through at least age four years. In each study women were recruited in
pregnancy or at defivery. In each the children delivered to these women have been followed over time.
The basic plan is reflected in Tables 1-6.(6) These tables summarize, for each study, the results
(adjusted for confounding) of each test of the relationship of a current or prior lead level with each cognitive
test. Each analysis in the obtained matrix was coded according to thc arbitrary classification, statistically
significant (p < .05) in the hypothesized direction.
These tables show no within-studies consistency with respect to either a particular time of exposure or
a particular form or time of outcome variable- Similarly, no similarity of patterns seen between studies. We
look next at the cumulative indices, including dentine lead, since these are nk're stable and more indicative of
overall wcpcxsm-e than the measures made at a single point in time.
The only one of the five studies in which an integrated PbB index was related to any outcome measure
was the Pe Pirie Study, in this study, an integrated average was related to the General Cognitive Index but the
effect was not very robust.
Only the Boston and the Cleveland Studies have reported results for dentine lead. In the Cleveland
Study there was a statistically significant effect (in the absence of any blood lead effect on IQ); in the Boston
Study there was no dentine lead cffiati.
Otter statistical issues
We know that the more statistical tests we do, the more likely we are to have some of these turn up
statistically significant even if, in truth, there is no effect in the population..(7) Only a small portion, from 1%
to 13%, of analysts in any of the prospective studies reached the criterion of .p < 0.05. These studies arc
humongous, with lots of variables, so these are many opportunities to se-arth the dataset for favorable results.
The same approach is taken by some reviewers, including the staff at EPA (8), who select au.alyses that
support the position to be taken and ignore the balance of the work.
Other kinds of statements are used to enhance or exaggerate the size of lead effects findings. The first
is of the form: -cognitive deficits were associated with blood lead levels as low as X ag/dl."Phis kind of
conclusion is drawn when a damsel with MB ranging from X to Yagfdl is related (sometimes just barely) to
10. Clearly the case or cases at X ,g/dl cannot be showing a deficit because there arc no lower Pbri values with
which they can be contrasted. It is sometimes said that no evidence of a threshold was fcanad. there is seldom
enough data to detect a threshold if there is one.
Regression coefficients are often used to describe the size of an effect_ With the coefficients one can
generate statements of the form: a deficit of X IQ points was found for each Yg/dl increase in blood lead.
These statements are usually generated for the worst-case analysis in the dataset.

between the categories is quite large and the correlation rather weak. Thus wire code configuration is not a good
predictor of the average magnetic field strength.
Nevertheless, in this area of research the focus remained on magnetic fields. As a possible explanation
for the above discrepancy Savitz and colleagues proposed that spot measurements are subject to more
misclassification than wire codes. The spot measurements are a one-time measure of fields which are known
to be extremely variable and thus an imprecise assessment of long-term exposure, which of course is the exposure
of interest.
The next study by London et aL added a 24-hour measurement to the exposure protocaL By the;
instruments had been developed to measure magnetic fields as often as desired and thus the latest study added
longer term measurements to 'wire codes and spot measurements.
Unfortunately, this methodology failed to provide better risk prediction. What remains is a fairly
consistent association of wire code configuration with cancer risk; a much weaker association of measured fields
with disaase risk and the fact that wire codes do not predict measured fields very well.
A closer look at the two wire code studies, one done in Denver, the other in Los Angeles, reveals that
while both show a positive correlation of similar magnitude between wire codes and cancer, the actual average
measurements in the two studies, for each of the wire code category, are quite different.
This slide presents the results (ie., the odds ratios and confidence intei-vals) of similar studies done in
the US. and Europe. When a study utilized both wire codes and actual measurements, both were plotted. In
all of the studies the association with cancer is stronger for wire codes than for measured fields and in some
cases achieves statistical significance.
There follows a summary of the results of three recent meta-analyses with the focus on childhood
leukemia. The three are quite different in many respects. They include varying numbers of studies. Some
include the study with the original finding, Le., that which generated the hypoirsis, other chose to exclude it.
Exposure of choice is different among the meta-analysis shifting from wire codes to measured fields.
Nevertheless, the resultant pooled estimates are quite similar, and as one would expect, from the previous slide,
demonstrate the stronger and statistically significant association of disease with wire code configuration as
compared to measured field.
This is a paradox which needs to be resolved. Several explanations have been put forth. One is that
magnetic fields are, in fact, responsible for the observed association but that wire codes retied the important
historical exposure more so than current measured time-weighted average fields.
Another thought is that the focus on average field strength is misplaced. Magnetic fields are extremely
complex, and it may be that other aspects or metrics, such as transients or other high but short-duration
exposures, may he the important factors.
A third hypothesis is that this association is not due to magnetic fields, but in fact, to some other
confounding factor(s) or to other biases in all of these studies.
A similar picture is seen for childhood brain cancer. While leukemia, the most common childhood
cancer represents more than one-third of the malignancies, brain cancer is the second most common;
approximating one-fourth to one-third of the cases. The remainder are a variety rarer cancers. Although fewer
studies have examined brain cancer, they show a stronger albeit less precise association than leukemia studies.
Again, the association is stronger for wire codes than for measured fields, and meta-analysis shows a similar
finding, that there exists a small but significant risk.
The residential studies of magnetic field exposure generated interest in the occupational environment.
The hypothesis was that, as with chemical exposures, if the ENIFs arc carcinogenic, thcethe effect will be even
162
566405722
(

more pronounced in the occupational setting where exposures are, in fact, much higher. To examine this
hypothesis, investigators turned to other data bases to examine electrical occupations and their associated risk
estimates.
There have been many such studies petformed, all based on existing data. They can be divided into
three types of investigations: hypetheeas-gencrating, case-control and cohort. In general, although earlier
hypothesis generating studies pointed to some effect, most investigations don't show consistent excess risk
associated with magnetic field exposure. Poor exposure categorization have plagued all occupational studies.
Hypotheses generating studies often used cadging data bases and derived occupation from that fisted on the death
certificate.
The ease-control studies have somewhat better exposure categorization, but, again, based on a surrogate,
Le, job titles. No measurements were done in any of these studies. Typically, they focused on fifetitue
occupational history- The risk estimates &oar case-control studies, though not uniform or dramatic, are the only
ones that suggest a possible effect, the results of cohort studies are largely negative and do not support the excess
observed in case-control studies.
A major problem with this methodology is that not all work environments categorized as electrical
occupations do, in fact, have high EMF exposure. An example is that of the. electrician who works with
equipment that is de-ersagized_ Nevertheless, even though this exposure classification scheme is crude, electrical
occupations, oil the average, to have higher exposures than non-electrical jobs, thus providing a natural grouping
of high vs. less exposed workers.
However, when exposures inherent to specific electrical occupations are examined, there is no dose-
response relationship to risk of cancer. This is demonstrated by a comparison of welders with electricians.
Welders have measured average epostues which are quite high ranging from 20 to 50 milligams. Electricians
have lower average exposures, wowed 2.5 millieauss which arc similar to residential exposures. The risk
estimates associated with these jobs do not reflect these discrepancies in level of exposure and thus do not show
a dose-response effect.
The phenomenon of increased risk with increased exposure is considered important in proving causation.
It absence raid-s questions. A possible explanation is that this data on exposure and disease has been compiled
from many sources. i.e., risk of disease may be from one study, exposure measurements from another. Another
possibility is that the averages might not be the right metric and that once we capture the relevant exposures a
clearer relationship will emerge. Methodologically improved studies are currently underway. It is anticipated
that the results of these studies will be more definitive
The first meta-analyses of leukemia in electrical occupations was done in 1987 and included 11 studies.
A meta-analysis was done again in 1992 incorporating the 24 studies, some of which were published in the
interim period. The risk estimates remained essentially the same.
An additional met a-analysis was perfoinied on preferred or selected studies. It excluded those thought
to have methodologic problems such as PMR studies or studies which presented only those risk estimates that
were high and/or statistically significant. The pooled estimate was apin consistent with those of the other meta-
analyses. Investigator s used the meta-analysis technique to look at specific occupations as opposed to electrical
occupations in general and at specific types cif cancers and leukemia subtypes. This analysis revealed a higher
risk estimate for aaute leukemia and particularly cot acute myeloid leukemia.
To demonstrate the issue of pubhcaluto Use and ite influence on meta-analysis, consider studies of
childhood Lancer and oecupational magnetic [kid exposure of parents. The relevant studies are all case-control
or design. Initial studies were positive, but the iisk did not persist in later investigations. Nevertheless, a pulled
estimate of three studies would inistaken11., t,hoo: an ctssuci.stion of parental exposute and childhood cancrr.
566405723
;63

To summarize the state of epidemiologic results, it is that the association with wire codes seems to be
the robust association. While the measured fields are much less predictive of risk, the issue of magnetic field
exposure is, potentially, of great public health importance. Even if the risks are small in magnitude, the exposure
is ubiquitous. Unfortunately, meta-analyses, though it did confirm an effect with wire codes, did not provide
additional insights into potential of this exposure as a carcinogenic agent, more work is needed to understand
the association between wire codes and childhood cancer.
In the occupational area, results from recent studies have not changed the pooled estimates confirming
small excess of cancer, specifically leukemia and brain cancer in electrical occupations. However, the reason for
this excess is not clear. While exposure to ENIF is higher in those occupations, the magnitude of exposure and
risk seemed to be uncorrelated It is quite possible that the true effect is actually much stronger but the way
in which the studies are performed dilutes or diminished it. It is also possible that no true risk exists. Larger,
more focused studies which incorporate detailed exposure assecsment are currently underway.
I would like to end my presentation with a joke that emphasizes the importance of valid comparison,
which has been mentioned many times during this c.e.s.ion. Recently, the Russian Minister of Economy was
cknel, what is his prediction for the coming year; what is going to happen, and he said, "Well, I think the coming
year is going to be just average. It is going to be worse than last year, but better than the next."
Thank you.

Some groups use log transformation of the lead data. This rneans that decrements in JO calculated
using the regression coefficient are greater at the tower end of the blood lead range. There is no good reason
to think that decrements should be larger at the lower end. This kind of calculation is deceptive. It is based
on the worst ease analysis and k gives the impression of greater precision than we can justify.
The sightings of the Monster are not consistent and our searching methods tend to magn;fy and even
distort whatever we have seen- We cannot say that the Monster isn't there. It may have a form that we haven't
considered. We don't really know what it 1 ooks like. We aren't always sure whether we are seeing it or whether
our sighting is of T./win-slang else. We can say, however, that if it is there, it is small, a little beastie.

FOOTNOTES
1. Relative risk and odds ratio ficires can be very deceptive. If the number of cases in the affected range is very
small, as shown her; a reclassification or addition of a few cases can be critical. The use of this statistic can
be misused in another way. The usual use is for dichotomous variables but when continuous variables such as
lead level and IQ are used cut-offs are introduced_ Since we don't have widely accepted cutting points for these
variables it is possible to optimize the ratio to be reported by trying out all plausible cuts and selecting one to
suit oneself.

DISCUSSION
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Emhart. Comments or questions?
Yes, sir?
DR. LE VOIS: Dr. LeVois, again. I have read a numbe.r of studies that your graphs were based on
and have conducted a blood lead study of my own. One thing that strikes me, you didn't mention very much
about the error of measurement, but as I reviewe,c1 these studies, the ones that claimed to show an effect, show
an effect that is approximately equal to the standard error of the Wise as it is norme4, and it strikes me that if
you cannot do much better than the standard error of the instrument that you are using, and you have an
outcome like intelligence that is so multiply or overdetermined; there are so many things that contribute to
intelligence that you haven't measured that you would have to really question whether or not what you are seeing
is in fact, something real or is an artefact There are other errors of measurement as well, but just the error
in measuring IQ is something that concerns me a lot in these studies.
PROF. ERNHART: I think your point is well taken. When we are looking though at measurement
error and the outcome, the error tends to lean toward a type 2 error as opposed to a type 1 error, and
considering the decision on the results of the study, and much as we would 14e to tighten the measurement error
in IQ or the equivalent thereof, the effect is toward the type 2 decision error.
DR LE VOIS: I have run into that argument before, and that is somewhat circular. That is true only
if measurement error exists in the presence of a true effect. If the effect that you are seeing is a result of
confounding, and there is really no true effect, then error in measurement doesn't bias towards the null. It just
has no effect at all, and what you are seeing then is the result of artefacts. So, you really can only talk about
type 1 and type 2 errors once you know the reality, know whether there is a true effect or not.
PROF. ERNHART: I think your point is well taken.
DR. FEINSTEIN: The thing that struck me in looking at some of this literature, Dr. Emhart is that
they seem to measure the child's intelligence as best they Can, and then they try to measure the mother's as best
they can, and they never measure the father's. Now, in the error of single parents, I can understand that, but
nevertheless, there is a contribution from two parents biologically, and I am just wondering what is the sexist
discrimination against men that has allowed their, kept their 10's from being considered as another confounder
in the IQ of the child?
PROF. ERNHART: Both as a feminist and as an investigator, I agree with you, and I, myself, have
used only mothers, and I have used quick and dirty tests that are not very, not as valid and have a lot more
measurement error than I would like. The main problem is it is hard to gct hold of the fathers. They are much
less likely to be involved in the child's development in the population that I have worked with which is primarily
welfare. The fathers kind of come and go, and we cannot track them down, and men arc more reluctant, I think,
in general, to participate in this kind of research. It is hard to get the mothers, and so, we get father's education
as a crude surrogate, and I wish we could do a better job with that.
DR. FEINSTEIN: With the ingenuity of the investigators, can't you get a proxy father?
(Laughter.)
PROF. ERNHART: I think we could get into some really interesting problems that way, but it is a good
point, and the entire problem of handling all of the confounding, we would love to have someone sit for days
watching the mother and what she does with her child. We do darned well with a period of about an hour or
an hour and one-half watching the mother with tbe child. In lace we can predict a child's IQ with a correlation
1 8 2
566405731

of about .40 to .45 just watching how the mother teaches, looking around; are there books, newspapers, what kind
of to al/ of these kinds and particularly how the mother involves with the child_ Does she brush him off when
he ackr a question or does she respond? Does she explain thin v to him? Does she take him places where she
is teaching him as she works, develops with him, and of course, a father can do that, too, but most of them
aren't.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much.
Our last formal paper of the morning is The Formaldehyde Experience. We have had several
experiences this morning. We have had a lead experience, a tamoxifen experience and now we have a
formaldehyde experience from Thomas B. Starr of the Environ Corporation in North Carolina.

THE FORMALDEHYDE EXPEREENCE
Thomas B. Starr
Environ Corporation, North Carolina
DR. STARR: Okay, I want to thank the Organizing Committee for inviting me back to talk about
formaldehyde again here. The first time I came to Tax Forum 8 years ago, I was invited to talk about
formaldehyde, with Jim Gibson while we were both still at cnT, and we made the pitch then that the animal
evidence for the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was compelling, but that if you looked at the mechanism of
action information that was developing at the time, it didn't look like there was much concern, as long as the
exposures that people experienced either in the environment or in the workplace were kept very low, and last
year when I was here, not to talk but just to listen and enjoy myself in Aspen, I had to go back to Washington
in the middle of the week to participate in an EPA meeting with its own Science Advisory Board in which the
basic arguments that we had laid out 8 years ago and continued to develop over time were being proposed by
EPA to its SAB, ia effect reducing the cancer potency that the agency would use by about 50-fold relative to
what it would have been in 1987, largely on the basis of animal evidence.
As a consequence of the composition of that board, that proposal got very mixed reviews, and in fad,
what they did was grumble that there ought to be some way to develop an estimate on the basis of the human
evidence.
So, my topic today, I guess, is a foreshadowing perhaps of what may be coming out of the agency in
terms of the use. of meta-analytic methods to look at the more than 35 or so studies of formaldehyde workers
and other people exposed in an attempt to modify the risk associated with that exposure.
I want to start, and this is different from what other people have said so far. I am going to use the
animal evidence and biological plausibility to structure the meta-analysis that I do. I am not going to do certain
things as a consequence of the animal evidence So, let me show you some of it. It won't take very long because
I know you are hungry, and we are running behind.
This is the outcome of the first formaldehyde bioassay that showed a significant increase in nasal cancer
among Fisher 144 rats that were exposed for up to 2 years, simulating an occupational exposure 6 hours a day,
5 days a week, and over half of th animals in that high dose group of about 1.5 parts per million developed
tumors. If you want to talk about a relative risk, the background rick of squamous cell carcinomas in animals
runs about 1 in 10,e100, if you will look at the historical controls from NTP studies. So, we are talking about a
relative risk here of about 5000-fold, and that is a big number. There is no question that a real effect was
observed here, and the basic problem is one of inference to the much lower exposures that people would tolerate
or experience That very steep dose response we, over the years, investigators at CTIT and other places have
been able to tease apart some of the factors that are important.
This is a display of a measure of exposure that is better than job class-die-at-ion. This is a measure of how
much formaldehyde ends up binding covalenrly to the DNA and specific target tissues in the rat and for
comparison in the monkey which is thought to be a better model for most humans than rats. There may be a
few exceptions, but I am not going to enumeratr them here.
It is plotted in an unusual way. Airborne concentration is need ii) normalize the covalent binding So.
if there were a linear relationship between binding and airluituc coacentratiim, these plots should be flat,
independent of the airborne concentration. Yoe' see that they are not. So, there is evidence of a significant
non-linear relationship between binding and target tissue to DNA arid airborn concentration that parallels what
was seen in ihz71,ii...bsay.

CaMMINIC-
J
The studies in monkeys were not done for as long, but what you can see is that there is a significant
decrease in the amount of binding in the monkey in comparison to the rat.. The question is why is that? Is the
monkey particularly efficient at removing cross links or preventing them from forming; is it a matter of mouth
breathing versus obligate nasal breathing that the rat goes through? Whatever the ease though, the implication
if this were the factor svould be that monkeys would be at less risk at the same airborne concentrations, and EPA
basically has, it is probably the wrong way to say it, they bought the argument, but if OM looked carefully at the
distamtion of cross links in the animal data, and in particular in the monkeys, if you looked at them as a
function of concentration we could see a tremendous effect at 6 parts per million, and we found DNA binding
all the way down to the first branch in the bronchi, the carina, and that was an indication that perhaps
formaldehyde was penetrating in the monkey deeper into the upper respiratory tract than it does in rats.
We, also, found that at .7 parts per million, and this is a qualitative scale, so you cannot see it, there. was
a disproportionate concentration of formaldehyde in the anterior portions of the respiratory tract with less
detected farther down_
An important observation was that there wasn't any cross linking in the sinuses of the monkeys, even
though in epidemiology studies the nasopharyngeal and sirionasal cancers have been singled out as potentially
a consequence of formaldehyde exposure, and wc could find no evidence for binding in the lung at all.
-It
INN
So, that should color, that should add some quality factors to the studies that 1 ant going to talk about.
esceen nroliferation in the target tissues were done that compared observations

So, metabolism to formate was so rapid that it wasn't formaldehyde that was reaching systemic tissues.
As they mentioned here, an increase in brain cancer in certain groups Nvho preserve human tissue is unexplained,
but it seems unlikely that this increase is due to formaldehyde, as it is not shown by heavily exposed industrial
groups. So, I am not going to pay any attention at all to non-topical sites. The ones I am going to look at arc
called topical sites, and the panel's conclusion on these reads as follows 'These sites have a plausibility that is
lacking in the case of non-topical sites, but with the exception of lung cancer, the topical sites are rare, and
there is a paucity of studies of them. The recognition of we,akneacas in studies that have reported an association
between potential formaldehyde exposure and cancer of the nasal sinuses or nasopharynx is not the same as
explaining away their findings. Although individual studies of cancer of the sinuses, pharynx and lung have shown
significant association with exposure, overall there is no concicrency among studies for any of the-cc sites:
So, they basicaly told me where I had to come out if I was going to do this calculation, at least
qualitatively, and these are the quantitative results for comparison.
First, let us look in order of the targets, the nasal cavity; we will look at nasopharyngeal cancer first, and
I will say just a few words about these studies. The first one, by Aaron Blair done in 1986, is the largest study
of industrially exposed workers.
Over 24,000 workers were evaluated. Their experience was evaluated, in 10 different plants. Six
nasopharyngeal cancers were observed among these workers versus two expectecl, and as you can see, that is a
marginally significant result. These are 90 percent confidence intervals on the actual SMR in that study. That
is a retrospective cohort mortality study.
When they looked carefully at where those cancers came from, five of them came from a subgroup of
workers that were exposed to formaldehyde in very dusty conditions, and four of them came out of one plant.
So, it is quite likely that the dusty conditions and perhaps the conditions specific to one plant or one set of job
categories was the culprit and not formaldehyde per se. At the very least you cannot rule out some kind of
association between dust and formaldehyde. Perhaps formaldehyde adsorbs onto the particulate matter, is
inhaled, reaches targets more effectively.
The other two studies are case-controlled studies. Olsen examined nasopharyngeal cancer in Denmark.
Vaughn looked at nasopharyngeal cancers in the State of Washington. Again, six observed cancers in both cases.
The real advantage here is that there is control for certain things like smoking habits to the extent that that is
possible. If you just combine them without waiting for their relative qualities, and let the sample sizes dictate
the relative influence of each of the studies in the overall., we do get an overall relative risk of about 1.5, but it
is not statistically significant.
Sinonasal cancer, and this is probably the one that has caused the most fuss, I guess because the
evidence is perhaps the most compelling that there is some kind of effect, at least an association with other
exposure.
Now, we have the Blair study up again on the top. The other large, very large cohort mortality study by
Atchison of British workers in six chemical plants in England, there were no sinonasal cancers observed. I
should mention that there weren't any observed nasopharyngeally either, but we don't have an expected value
to compute estimates with there. So, that particular study didn't show up in the nasopharyngeal analysis.
Then a series of case-controlled studies, two of which, the Olson study that [mentioned of Danish nasal
cancers and Hayes' study of ainonasal cancer in the Netherlands show significant effects.
Now, Olson was careful to control for or to be able. to ascertain exposure to wood dust, paint arid
lacquer, glue and other exposures and what is interesting about that study is that if you do that adjustment and
just look at the effect of fornaildehydc, it lapses into statistical insignificance.
566405735
116

So, again, if there is any indication of an effect here, it would be of a combination between formaldehyde
and particulate exposure.
Overall, I do get an SMR which is aignificantly greater than one at the .05 level, but if one were to drop
those two studies out where there is clearly wood dust exposure, it is known to be a nasal carcinogen, that
number would lapse into statistical insignificance, as well.
Now, here we have lung cancer which is sufficiently common that some reasonably good statistics could
be assembled, and there are 17 studies, I believe up on that figure. Blair and Atcheson's studies are the biggest.
'There are a few other retrospective mortality studies, both of industrially exposed workers and the professional
groups which are labeled with a capital P, and then on the bottom there are five proportional mortality studies
They get less weight just because of the small number of deaths that were observed there, and they should
probably get even less weight because there are problems with PMR studies that don't show up in retrospective
cohort mortality studies, but nevertheless that is the pattern.
The only statistically aigalificant finding was one by Bertazi reported in 1986, of Italian workers in the
chemical industry, and they looked pretty carefully, well, I shouldn't say, 'Pretty carefully,' they looked reasonably
carefully at the kind of exposure these various job categories had They divided it up into formaldehyde
exposure, other exposures and unknown exposures, and what I am showing you there is the finding for all of
those exposures compared to some background population rates of death from lung cancer.
Had they stratified on those and looked just at the formaldehyde exposed individuals, the excess lapses
into statistical insignificance again, and in fact, the unknown exposed category and the other exposed category
had higher SMR's than did the formaldehyde-exposed one.
So, be that as it may, that is the one truly statistically significant finding.
If you go into the details and try to tease things out, find particular groups with particular latencies or
durations of exposure, you might find a few excesses here or there, and that argument has gone on in the
literature. It went on very hot and heated until the late eighties, and as you can see, basically nothing much has
changed All of the large groups of people that are exposed to formaldehyde at reasonably hie levels have been
studied, and what we find is that overall their mortality from lung cancer is basically noasimal. There doesn't
appear to be any effect at. all.
I just wanted to mention so that you keep this in mind that there are difficult issues in doing this kind
of thing that I have completely glossed over; not being an epidemiologist, not being a biologist, 1 can get away
with thaL Not being a statistician, I can get away with other things, too, but the studies are of highly variable
quality, and what we have done is include sample size as a factor implicitly, but there are other issues that have
been alluded to earlier. There is real heterogeneity in exposures here. The professional groups were largely
exposed to formalin, the industrial groups to urea formaldehyde resins, phenolic resins, and the characterization
of exposure is very non-uniform.
Largely in the retrospective cohort mortality studies, on the basis of job category, some studies did a
really good job of that; other studies only paid lip service to that, and there was inadequate control of
confounders.
No retrospective cohort mortality stud) was able to take account of smoking habits, and as far as lung
cancer is concerned, that is certainly one thing you would want to know something about.
So, there are many unresolved and difficult issues that would be required, at least to be addressed before
a regulatory agency would base an assessment on that human evidence, but for conclusions, I think the blue
ribbon panel said it best, and I am just going to reiterate those conclusions. For no malignancy in man is there
convincing evidcuce of a relationship with formaldehyde exposure. If a relationship does exist, the excess risk
in absolute terms must Ire
187
566405736

Now, that is a real waffle conclusion if I ever saw one, but I think it is about as hard as you can push
because we have already heard Dr. Emhart say that yonsimply cannot prove the negative. You cannot rule out
arbitrarily small risks associated with exposure. What we can say is that there really isn't any weidence of thit
There is no evidence of cancer risk either in humans or in animals, except at extremely high levels, levels that
we would never tolerate.
So, I think any meta-analysis of these studies is going to have to conclude that way. Various studies will
be even more or less weight, but the ones that do soggiest a paisitive relationship have confounding exposures
that need to be dealt with, and those will probably get formaldehyde off the hook.
Thank you very muck

DISCUSSION
DR FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dr. Starr_
Arc there comments or questions for Dr. Starr?
Go ahead, sir?
DR. SCHEUPLF-IN: Tom, as you said, there was no doubt that at high levels in animals in mom of
6 to 10 parts per million you find tumors in the nasal regions of rats.. The levels that you were looking at, you
say were much smaller in people. Exposures were much smaller. One would then conclude from that that
perhaps there is consistency between the animal studies and the human studies, but the doses were too low.
That leads to the question, how high viere the doses relative to the animal studies? Generally the startles
that wure done best, how does the exposure in those situations compare to the cloud of formaldehyde that the
animals had to endure over their lifetime?
DR STARR.: They arc within an order of magnitude.. They are within a factor of 10. There is no
question_ I think the critical factor here is the steepness of the non-linear relationship between ambient
concentrations of formaldebyde and the tumor response in rats. It is one of the steepest dose-response curves
observed. So, you can reduce exposure by a relatively small amount, a factor' of three arid drop the cancer
incidence by 50-fold in the animal studies.
DR. SCHEUPI -FIN: And you looked at the studies in which order of magnitude was 1 part per
milbon?
DR. STARR: The OSHA panel was somewhere like 3 or 5 ppm, with a 10 ppm short-term limit, and
people simply could not experience a 10 ppm exposure for more than a few minutes, at most. So, the exposures
have to be smaller.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Dr. Shubik?
DR SHUIRK: Tom, if you look at all these epideaniologic studies very carefully, as I have done and
you have done, obviously there isn't a single one of them that stands up all on its own because each one has
problems with pathology, and so forth, and it would seem to me that looking over all this material together, it
would make it alvaolulely clear use of meta-analysis in this instance would be entirely inappropriate and
nonsensical I think this is one of the best arguments for saying that there are very severe limitatioas, indeed.,
for use of meta-analysis in the context of this particular meeting
DR STARR: I would certainly agree with respect to formaldehyde, Dr. Shubik. It probably is
inappropriate to do that with the studies that we have at hand, given their variety of limitatious and the real
diffamIty with ascertainment of what real exposure conditions were, but even if you do --
DR. SHUBEK: Could you change your phraseology a little bit and say, rather than probably,
"Absolutely'?
DR. STARR: You can do that if you like.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I don't think, Dr. Shubik, I have ever seen any meta-analytic advocacy discussion in
which the meta-analyst says that there is some stuff that is so bad that it cannot be analyzed. Nothing is ever
so bad that it cannot go through the mill

566405738

DR. STARR: The moral of that story is that fools rush in, where angels fear to tread, and the point
of this is that if they do it, if they do use the epi to bound human cancer risks, they arc not going to come out
with a very satisfying number. It is going to be quite small, but it won't be inconsistent with the animal evidence
because exposure is so poorly characterized.
Are there any other questions?

PANEL DISCUSSION
We now come to the panel dicerission where the various panelists who have been on this morning pass
in review, giving you one last opportunity to throw stones or flowers at them. There are seven such panekts
and we could, I suppose, try to line up seven chairs down here and bring them all down or alternatively, since
this is a splendidly shaped room and everybody can see everybody, we could just have that discussion go on with
people seated where they arc without everyone having to conic down_
How many of you would like the panelists to come down here and sit before you?
(There was a show of bands.)
DR. FEINSI hIN: How many would like them to sit where they are?
(There are a show of hands.)
DR. FEINSTEIN: How many would like this whole thing called off so that you can go to lunch_
(Laughter-)
DR. FEINSTEIN: All right, let me just identify where they are as you get ready to throw the things.
Claire Emhart is there. Tom Starr is there. Ernst Wynder is there. I am looking for Michael Friedman
Michael Friedman is there. Dr. Kheifets is here. So, you are all, if we were arranged politically seated on the
left wing, and ready for the questions to come.
Yes, sir?
DR. SOMOGYI: Arpad Somogyi, Federal Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany. I would like to come
hack to the question of passive smoking. I believe that the tremendous public health sigtificance of the
evaluation of human health dictates that we cannot afford to be too glib about this subject. I believe that
inherent in the current methodology, the limitations of current methodology, we just are unable to judge the
situation for the time being. Measuring cotenine in urine of recent vintage, it is, I believe, not relevant if you
are trying to study a disease with 1.5, 20 or 30 years of latency period.
The current situation in the United States where smoking in public buildings and airplanes went
dramatically back during recent years doesn't allow us to make conclusions which would reach back as long as
10 to 20 years, and the situation in Europe basically is very different. Smoking is quite another matter in the
European setting. So, I would like to ask the panelists whether there is really a possibility for the time being
to have a huge study which would imply that we are finding an appropriate non-exposed situation, considering
the omnipresence of environmental tobacco smoke in many societies.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I am sorry, I did not identify Paul Switzer when I went around. Is he here? Paul,
do you have any lead-off comments in your answer to that?
PROF. SaNTTZER: I believe the question had to do with whether a study could be designed which
would ascertain the population distribution of exposure to E IS in some reasonable way. Is that it? So, it is
basically an exposure study, ib whAt you are asking for rather than a health effects study.
T91
566405740

It is my impression that there are some studies under way to try to assess micro-environmental
exposures, that is by carrying instruments into homes and into bars and workplaces and so forth to try to
ascertain the variabilities of concentration in these micro-environments in order to build some type of, in order
for the purpose of building a model where we can establish the frequency distribution of ETS exposure across
a population based on activity patterns. That is the only thing that I know about, and this gets away from the
method of establishing exposure distributions through urinary cotenine measurements.
DR FEINSTEIN: Did you have a comment, Dr. Wynder?
DR. WYNDER: Obviously this question is scientifically imperative and politically almost impossible
to deal with. I am one who probably has done more work on smoking and cancer than anybody in this room
for 40 years. You know that active smoking is clearly the major cause of preventable death in the United States.
The question is scientifically whether small amounts of passive inhalation of tobacco smoke or polluted
air can produce cancer in humans, and let mc, also, preface I agree with thc point Dr. Adamson made before.
Passive inhalation of smoke plays an important role in lung tfiscase in young children, and it ought to be
outlawed wherever people want to inhale clear clean air.
Now, the scientific question, I believe can be answered if we do a serious investigation of this important
problem. This includes, as I have done for 40 years to study lung cancer in non,-smokers. I have written four
papers on that alone. It includes that if we do case-controlled studies, we do them n in a way where we will never
include proxies where every case is interviewed by a trained interviewer and hopefully by the investigator himself,
When I began my studies I didn't hire interviewers. I did over 500 interviews myself, and I flow sheeted
them, and then you get a pretty good idea what the patient tells you and the kind of control you want to use.
Unfortunately, today most people who report have never seen the patient, have never seen the data until the data
come out of a computer, and so, they have no sense as to how the patient replied, and the point I am making
here, it is a very important study, and if we did it right in case-controlled studies where every case would be
interviewed in detail, where all confounders are considered, where all misclassification is properly dealt with, I
think we can come up with the final answer, but whatever the final answer is, dearly we all are entitled to inhale
the cleanest air possible. So, for me, as I said, politically it is an area which certainly most of us don't want to
deal with, but as scientists I think we have an obligation to scientific facts themselves because this question is
answerable, and we will continue at the American Health Foundation to address this very important question.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I would agree with Dr. Wynder that I think the studies can be made much more
scientific than the slovenly work that has hitherto been done, but I think it does require an acknowledgement
of how sloppy the stuff has been, that the kind of stuff that has been done in the past is simply not acceptable,
that you just cannot get away with it, but as long as people think they can get away with it, they do.
I would add further, not only to Dr. Wynder's request that the interview be longer and more detailed
but I would want the interviewer not to know who is a case and who is a control when the interview was
conducted, and I would, also, want several other decoy hypotheses inserted into the research not simply the single
hypothesis. That would bring perhaps into the world of epidemiology some of the things that we have learned
about science from doing randomized trials, but at the moment, I just don't think that that is going to happen.
Yes, six?
DR. LA.YARD:. My name is Maxwell Layard_ I am a consultant in statistics. I would like to ask Dr.
Wyndcr a question. That Will Williams' study, ETS study that Dr. Switzer referred to, the author suggested that
any ETS effect may have been masked by indoor air pollution due to cooking and heating devices, and my
question is, Dr. Wynder, do you think this is a luasooablc inference? Is it plausible that Soule other pollution
could eliminate an effect of ETS?
?
566405741
 Nmilas

DR. WYNDER: D. Hammond and I, years ago, published a paper on general air pollution and lung
can, and we concluded that if you properly standardize your data for smoking, and active smoking is such an
overwhelming case cause of lung mincer that general air pollution falls by the wayside, and the standardization,
of course, in one slide I pointed out includes not just how many cigarettes smoked and how long you smoked
and whether you deeply inhale or whether you smoke down to the very butt end and the brand of cigarette you
smoke, and if you don't do that, then you never come up with the right answer, and I think this, by and large,
has, also, not been done for general air pollution and in particular I did a study in Venice in 1961. It just shows
you that we in epidemiology occasionally have great ideas. I spent that summer in Venice and compared the
incidence of lung cancer in Venice with Durene(?) and Rome, and when you standardize the data for smoking,
no difference appeared, and we published this in Lancet in 1961.
There is one problem, Dr. Feinstein, which I think is probably not solvable in epidemiology, and that
is the way the patient responds to our particular answer. There is an inherent bias that I indicated before where
the case will always look at this question differently than control, and that I think is not present in cohort studies.
They have other problems, and I wonder, Dr. Feinstein, because if you ask a patient who is obese how much they
ate yesterday, and I used to work in an obesity clinic, and I will tell you I have never known an obese patient
to say that they ate a lot. So, there is an inherent bias in a response depending on what disease you have, and
there is another bias, Dr. Prawn published a study years ago on the bias in non-lung cancer patients as to how
much smoking there was done in the home, and when the daughters and sons answered the question the R value
was something like .4, and I would say that one of the inherent problems we have in epidemiology, and perhaps
one of you may see how we can overcome it; perhaps there is a psychiatrist here who can'heIp us, namely, I hope
there is no psychiatrist here, who can help us as to how you can measure the respoeie bias that the patient has
that depends on the social class, on his religion, on his disease and on his sex and on his age.
DR MIMI EIN: I don't know that it can be readily overcome, but I would say that it doesn't have
to be nugaifieel and emphasized by the way the questions are constructed.. For example, when you send out your
letter a solicitation, and when you conduct the interview, it is not necessary to say, "I am doing a study of Jung
cancer." You can certainly say, -We are trying to get hold of you because we are talksig to the spouses of the
relatives of all people like your husband who were in our hospital during such and such a year: That doesn't
state what particular condition you are after, and it doesn't have to magnify in their mind what they should be
getting their own biased answers ready to. It is little things of that sort that I think could be done that could,
at feast, if not stamp out the bias, not emphasize and magnify it the. way it is generally done, and that is the sort
of thing that I have in mind.
I'M, Dr. Shubik?
DR. SHUSIK In spite of the fact that in almost every instance of human carcinogenesis it requires
massive exposure, including cigarette smoke, we are faced with a general comxpt. I think it is one of the key
problems in the public health control of carcinogens that very, very, very low levels of carcinogen can, in fact,
cause cancer, and I think it is incredibly important to examine with a fine-tooth comb any evidence that says that
that is in fact so. At the top of the list facts that seem to bear on this happen to be on environmental tobacco
smoke. Insofar as cigarette smoking is concerned, there is clearly reasonably good dose-ret,pon_se data, but in
spite of the fact that there is, no one has ever been willing to eon= out and state categorically that if you smoke
one cigarette a day you are not likely to have an increased incidence of cancer as a result, and it seems to me
that there must be a whole lot of facts that could be gathered together that are staring us in the face which
would tell us how logical it was to consider that these low levels of cigarette smoke counted as environmental
tobacco smoke were, in fact, Likely to be dangerous or not.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I think your fundamental mistake is asking for loeic in this held.
Yes?
PARTICIPANT: (Off microphone) EPA. I have a practical question based on thc panel discussion this
morning, and what replies can the panel give to the environmental regulators. gov:2-rimcnt reguhuturm, who ase
566405742

in the business of doing risk assessment, and the reason I am asking this question here because of our most
recent experience clearing with chlorinated drinking water and bladder cancer. Certainly with meta-analysis we
can descienee toxicology, and where the authors concluded that 9 percent of bladder cancers are due to
chlorinated water, and 15 percent of rectal cancers are due to chlorinated water, and that was dearly based on
meta-analysis which somc of our elected ogriciats have some interest in this whole issue of meta-analysis.
Therefore, my question, if I can summarize it should we accept, refute or modify the application of meta-analysis
to risk assessment in selling regulations?
DR.. FEINSTEIN: Does anybody want to take that on? Do you want me to answer? I don't know the
EPA. I have been lucky enough not to have to consult for it and have not been involved in its activities. I have
read some things that have come out of it which have struck me as absolute political science, that have had
absolutely no scientific basis to them. I don't know how, if you work there, what sort of pressures you get, how
they are applied and whatnot. I have the feeling at times that the agency is a reed blowing in the wind that goes
with whatever thing gets at it in the same way that the FDA which I know more about was once defined as a
slow-moving target that bleeds profusely when hit.
At any rate, I think you have to separate the academic entrepreneurs and there are many of us, from
the commercial entrepreneurs, and there are many of them, and you have to recognize that just because some
academic entrepreneurs manage to get some publicity for what they have done does not necessarily mean that
that is the new standard of the era, and that just because some media person has given it publicity doesn't
necessarily mean that the agency that presumably represents levelheaded, cautio'us, scientific thinking has to move
in response to that.
So, you could take time. You could try to set some standards. You could contemplate that just because
a few elderly folks from Harvard happen to say in their meta-analysis that chlorinated water is now a hazard
doesn't necessarily mean that it is a hazard. I mean for all we know, some of the elderly folks at Harvard may
be getting Alzheimerian.
(Laughter-)
DR. FEINSMN: Or a new way of renewing tenure or something by getting a lot of publicity for your
paper, but it doesn't mean that that necessarily has to be the way you react. That is what has always surprised
me about some of the things that I have seen the EPA do.
PARTICIPANT: I wish it was Harvard It turned out to be Wisconsin,
(Laughter.)
DR. FEINSTEIN: No, I happen to have read that paper about the water, and the senior author is from
Wisconsin, but you have two elegant tailpieces there who were both from Harvard. I know both of them.
Yes, sir?
DR. WAGNER: Wagner, New York University. I am very much concerned about the comments made
by several spe2kers this morning concerning publication bias, and I think this is an important field. I would like
to call to your attention that in March of this year at Vanderbilt University a conference was held entitled
Philosophical and Ethical Considerations for Editors of Refereed Scientific Journals, and what prompted the
meeting was the issue of integrity in science, sometimes referred to euphemistically as fraud, and I would like
to just put to you, Al and the rest of the panel throe questions that we reviewed. The meeting was attended by
over 40 editors of not only biomedical journals but, also, journals in physics, chemistry, mathematics, psychology
and, also, editors from Europe, as well as the 'United States. Should statisticians be members of all editorial
boards? Should authors using spacial statistical methods make their raw data available to editois upon request?
Should editors of government reports on scientific health issues he reviewed in journals as hook reviews?
566405743
194

DR. FEINSTEIN: Your questions were, one, should statisticians be on the editorial boards of all
journals; I don't think so. I think they should be available as needed, just the way any other consultants are
available as needed, but there may be certain journals, for instance, I am thinking of the Journal of the History
of Medicine which almost never uses any statistics, and it might not need one on its editorial board.
Should the raw data be made available, if desired.? Sure. I think any scientific thing where the se-tent:kr
is unwilling to make raw data available is immediately suspect by that, and it should always be made available,
if desired. Should it be available without being desired? No. I can tell that as a reviewer, I would not want to
be deluged by the raw data, and as an editor I couldn't get reviewers if they threatened to be deluged with the
raw data so that it ought to be there if you want it, but not made available routinely, and what was 'your third
question?
DR. WAGNER: Should editors have government reports on scientific health issues be reviewed in their
journals as book reviews?
DR. FEINSTEIN: Oh, I think one of the ways in which government reports are issued is an absolute
scientific scandal in this country, and I don't see why it is that people in extramural programs, extramural to the
government should have to apply for grants, have those granted vetted by a careful committee and then when
they finish the work submit that for publication and have it go through peer review when somebody working
intranturally at some government agency doesn't have to have it checked out, either before they do the project
or afterwards, and I think that is kind of scandalous almost that that continues.
I think that the governmental things should be checked and vetted just like everything else is done.
Now, one of the problems is that given how crummy many of those government jobs arc and how badly
paid they are. and the fact that many people don't want to work in them is one of the ways in which you try to
recruit people is with the fact you can get easy grants. You can get easy publications, so that if you try to
toughen the scientific quality of what is going on within the agency publications, you will then have to improve
the attractiveness, if you want to recruit good people.
DR. FRIEDMAN: Al, I feel a need to respond. Friedman, NCI. I think what you are saying is no
more true. for government employees than it is for academic employees. For those individuals not fortunate
enough to work at Yale or at Harvard or Wisconsin but some other institution, I think they are faced with the
same environmental problems which you say are true and certainly are true of some government agencies, but
I think it is a shame to characterize things generally when there arc so many counterexamples. I can only speak
for one Institute, but I know the intramural scientists are very carefully scrutinizerl  They have site visits just like
an extramural investigator would, that the currency is, of course, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and it
is the same review process, whether it is an intramural scientist or an extramural scientist, and I think there is
some danger in overgeneraiization. There certainly arc plenty of examples that you can properly, legitimately
point to and say that these are very unsatisfactory, and I would agree with you, but there are many
counterexamples, and I think it would be a shame to characterize the whole system.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Let me immediately, Mike, exempt from my comment those parts of the NM that
do non-epidemiologie research.. The people who do basically reotarch in the lab, the people who do randomized
triaLs, I have not seen any really outrageous stuff coming out of there, and some of it in those intramural things
has been magnificent. What I was really commenting on was things that I have seen coming out of the other
branches of governmental agencies and of others that are not Nil-1 that rugulailly produce quantitative documents.
DR. FRIEDMAN: I don't want to extend this too much, and 1 appi eciate the difference that you are
drawing. There is a tine irony here that I am sure escapes nobody which is that those people who have
established the criteria for what is legitimate scientific integrity, that is the Legislative Branch of government in
some large measure overseeing that are the individuals who have whole portions of their speeches interpolated
into the congressional Record, and there is an ironic difference, the criteria that arc applied to them versus the
scientist who simply interpolated data would not be permitted to exist.
195 566405744

DR. FEENSTEIN : Yes, sir?
DR. ADAMSON: Adarrecon, NCL I would just like to add to what Mike Friedman had to say, that
the intramural scientists, and since you said, the non-epidemiologic portions, including the epidemiologists, do
undergo peer review at die NEI-I and do have scientific advisory boards and particularly with a lot of studies that
have to do with public health implications, also, have a special advisory committee with regard to those studies
during the study, during the protocol formulation, during the analysis of the results and during the reporting.
DR. FEINSTEIN: I think all I can tell you, sir is that from time to time, including just very recently
I see something published that has come out of there which if k were done by a master's degree thesis student
in our public health school, we would probably flunk that istuclart
DR. ADAMSON: That is your opinion, but I can tell you that some of those studies have high public
health relevance and have been site visited including people from the Ivy League universities.
DR, FEINSTEEN: Yes, sir?
DR WALBORG: Walborg, with Dermigen. We have heard a lot of criticism of the epidemiological
approach in trying to identify relative risks in the area of risks under the level of two. I woulcl like. to ask the
question, and it is directed at Dr. Kheifets, particularly, but others could comment on it, do you believe that an
epidemiological study can be designed that will unecanovocally identify a re1a0e risk less than two in populations
in which all of the controls have been exposed frooi conception?
DR. KHEIFEFS: First of all, I think you axe right. We have discassed a lot of epidemiology. I think
we should emphasize that in many ways it is the only way to go. That is the only relevant evidence, and I think
that all the other types of evidence could be equally criticized, and it is a relevant question, including their use
of aratis.tics in other sciences.
I think when we talk about the very small risks, it gets very difficult. I mean you cannot do an Ettlinni
study on the very small risk. Ionizing radiation is a good example. We know it is a carcinogen. We don't know
what happens at the very low levels because you cannot conduct any studies that would tell you, but you amid
do animal studies, but again, not at the very low levels_ So, I think once you deal with the very small risks, the
oats that we are dealing with, we. do have to base our conclusions on a variety of factors and look at a variety
of evidences and try to come up with the best answer, but I think that the answer is always going to be suspect
because we are dealing with a lot of different kinds of uncertainties including statistical uncertainties,
uncertainties due to exposure measurements, uncertainties due to types of studies we do and whether they are
based on animals or humans.
DR FEINSTEIN: We need to finish up soon to give time to clean the aircraft before the next crew
comes on. Wc will have two wore comments Wally?
DR. HAYES: Hayes, RJR. (Mcrophooe shorts out.)
One of the things that has been around is about the exposure issue, and I think Dick Hall brought up
an interesting point, that if you sample a variety of vegetables there arc dietary sources that ca.0 confound the
issues related to these areas.
The other thing that I think is even more impor rant is the fact that environmental nicotine really is not
a marker for the paiticular phase, that area wbere most of the chemicals are reportcd to be involved in
carcinogenic and other types of responses are toted. Even more than that, nicotine as opposed to most of
these other materials does trot 1K:tr1in by first order Kinetics, and that is if you have people smoking in a room
such as this, and you come back and measure feu nicotine 3 or 4 days later, you arc going to pick up nicotine,
but you will not pick up the pariicallate. materials. Even beyond that, analytical methods that arc used are not
566405745
196

really that well standardized. In fact, in most of the ATLC methods that are used, you will find that the cotenine
'o part of the curve, the caffeine is buried there, and if you are not careful you are going to get an erroneous
exposure bit of information.
Nonetheless, nicotine and cotenine are used as bioniaxkers, and when used to look at background
information data, one finds that there is a way that you can differentiate risk within a population. The
background, I have some slides that I was going to ask you. to show, but we really don't have time to do that.
One has to be very careful in epidemiology studies to be sure that the background correction is taken care of
and that is that you are sure that the exposure that you are getting is coming from the environmental tobacco
smoke and not front other sources, and this idea of classification, I think the question was asked todiy how many
people smoke, and nobody raised his hand, and we find that within The US population that the batch of smokers
you will often find in a couple of settings with in excess of 2000 people now, we place the overall background
correction levels somewhere between 8 and 10 percent of the US population, and when you fold this kind of
information into that 1,19 number that the EPA has, it drops it below the level of significance.
I think we do have the beginning on some of this exposure stuff that was suggested_ We need to look
at it very, very carefully when we are doing epidemiology studies.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Gin Gori, the last word?
DR. GORI: You announced my name. So, I thank you. I have two poinfs that I would like to pick
up, one by Phil Shubilc. He asked why didn't anybody ever raise the point 61,36 t low levels of smoking there
may be no risk. I think I have done that, of course, at the risk of being crucified which many here know I had
to undergo. I published, again, with Nate Mantelle the same issue of a threshold which is very apparent from
the epidemiologic evidence of active smoking just a year ago or so. A second point was raised by Michael
Friedman, I believe, when he pointed out that the method does not kill the data. It is people that kill the data.
We are not facing here, I believe in all this discussion this morning an issue of science. We are really, I believe,
facing an issue of ethics, and we have had many discussions of ethics in science in the last 2 years, but they have
focused mostly on capital sins, like publication of data and things of this sort. They have not focused on what
we may call peccadillos in science but which are just as important in terms of their misuse in public policy.
I think that this is an item that the scientific comutunity will have to address if scientists and science are
to remain a significant force in our civilization.
DR. FEINSTEIN: Thank you for your comments. I want to thank the various speakers who have
participated, thank the audience. Dr. Shubik has asked me to tell you that we will reconvene at 2:10 p.m.
Enjoy your lunch. They have roast peccadillos being served.
(Thereupon, at 12:50 p.m., a recess was taken until 2:05 pm., the same day.)

Effective use of a health care technique requires an accu-
rate assessment of the specific technique and its benefits,
risks, costa. and alternatives as applied to specific pioblems.
Such an sarnessment requires applying the technique in var-
ied clinical situations and publishing the resit/Ls in the medi-
cal literature. De facto rationing of forms of technology such
as MRI under the banner of cost containment impedes tech-
nology assessineni and thwarts improvement in patient tare.
This ultimately costs society and patients dearly in ternts of
delayed diagnoses, erroneous diagnoses, and needless ther-
apies.

THE NICOTINE CONTENT OF COMMON
VEGETABLES
- To the Editor: The presence of nicotine and us metabolite
cotinine in the body fluids of nonsmokers is usually taken as
evidence of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Re-
cently, the Cen (era for Disease Control and Prevention stud-
ied 800 people, both smokers and nonsmokers, all of whom
tested positive for urinary coot-line.'
There is considerable evidence that nicotine is present in
certain human foocis, especially plants from the family So-
lanaccac (asieh as potatOta, tomatoes, and eggplant). Castro
and Mort-j4,*Sheen,3 and Davis et al.4 have reported on the
nicotine content of foods and chinks. We have been able to
confirm some of their findings in our laboratory. Gas chro-
matography and mass spectroscopy' were used codetermine
the nicotine and cotinine content of common vegetables and
black tea available from a local super market The vegetables
analyzed were tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflower, and green
peppers. They were thoroughly washed with tap water, as is
done for human consumption All the vegetables were treat-
ed in a similar manner so that any contamination from the
tap water would be equally applicable. The vegetables (in-
cluding their skins) were diced, pureed in a blender, pre-
pared,' and assayed.'
Cotinine could not be detected in any of the samples
Measurable aannonts of nicotine were found in some of
the vegetables (Table 1). Green peppers, black tea, and Ann
Arbor city water had no detectable nicotine Table i com-
pares the results of the present study with those previously
reported.

to smoke is about I jag per cubic meter. A person weighing
70 kg with a tidal volume of 4 ml per kilogram of body
weight breathing 20 times per minute would exchange 5.6
liters of air per minute. If we assume that nicotine is com-
pletely absorbed from the lungs, it would take 179 minutes,
or about 3 hours, of breathing in an environment with mini-
mal smoke to absorb I jig of nicotine. Table I shows the
amount of each vegetable by aver weight one would have to
eat to obtain an amount of nicotine comparable to that of a
passive smoker. Of course, the route of absorption is quite
digevent in eating as compared with inhaling Furthermore,
if the vegetables are thoroughly cooked, the nicotine will
diffuse into the cooking water and less will be ingested. It
appears that the dietary intake of nicotine in nonsmokers
ray be of practical importance in the in terpranklii of the
Mae al passive smoke inhalation when one is determining
nicotine arid tuunine levels in body fluids.

imetry, plasma nicotine and cotininc. clinical pathology, and
organ and body weights. The only pathological response observed
was slight to mild epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in
the most rostra] part of the nasal cavity, in the high-exposure
group only. No effects were noted at medium or low exposures.
The minimal changes noted were reversible. using a subgioup
of animals kept without further treatment for an additiotial 14
days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated
that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical
or even 10-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was
only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle con-
centrations 100 times higher than preal real-world concentra-
tions. c 1942 soon, „i
Numerous statements have been made .n the scientific
literatute on the biological activity of environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS: Department of Health and Human Services,
1986: National Research ('ouncil. 198b). This study was de-
signed to obtain information on the eflects seen in animals
exposed to aged and diluted sidcstream smoke ( ADSS), at
concentrations equivalent and higher than those reported

scantly and usually include contributions of suspended par-
ticulates other than L S (DHHS, 1986). Consequently, the
ADSS target concentrations were chosen as (1.1. 1, and 10
intrjrnl. Respectively, these correspond to typical, extreme
for "worst-case), and ranger ared field measurements (01-
daker el al., 1000)
The prima] y cod-point of this study was the histopathology
of the respiratory tract and related organs, as assessed by a
pathologist with experience in rodent inhalation studies with
cigarette smoke the aims were to tieleirnine whether bio-
logical responses could be observed after exposure to ADSS
at different concentrations, what these observed responses
wcie. arid the no observed-effect-level i NO1-.1.1 for the study.
An additional objective was to study the lever sibility of any
changes observed after exrxuaire to ADSS. To study this re-
covery process, subgroups of' animals were kept for an ad-
ditional 2 weeks without treatment. at the end of the 14-day
exposure
Other end-points included DNA adducts and alveolar
macrophage cytogenclics. these arc ieported separately (1 ee

WTPM were 216 ± 0.32, 2.33 ± 0.11, and 1.90 0.11%
None of the above analytes could he detected at significant
concentrations in the sham chamber or in the exposure room.
In the exposure room. the mean ('O2 concentration (±SD,
n 16) was 403 20 ppm, iii the sham chamber the mean
(SD, is - 14) concentration was 1307 ± 58 ppm The mean
concentrations (± SD. n - 14) in the low, niedium, and high
chambers were 1522 t 01. 1458 ± 166, and 1841 + l(X)
ppm, respectively.
Particle size distobutions at the medium and high expo-
sures were similar, with the average values (thiee observa-
tions) being 0 42 and 0.29 pm, respectr.ely. The standard
geometric deviations were 1.52 and 1.80. Insufficient material
was obtained during the 6 hi of the low exposure for deter-
mination of particle size distribution.
In-Life Observations
There were no treatment-related clinical signs or monal-
arcs and the serology results were negative. Animals in the
smoke-exposed groups showed body weights that were similar
to those in the shai» group (Figs. 4, 5).
Blood COHb concentrations at the end of the exposures
were negligible in the sham low-exposure groups. The means
for the medium and high groups (sexes combined, .-±SD, n
- 30) were 0.91 ± 0.46 and 5 80 -.± 0.94%, respectively.
The ELISA assay had limits of detection (LOD) of 4.5
13 ng/m1 for nicotine and 6.9 ± 7.6 non] for cotinine. The
sham and low-exposure groups had plasma nicotine con-
centrations at or below the LOD: the medium-exposure
group had plasma nicotine concentrations above the LOD
hut below the limit of quantification. The mean plasma rue-

this latter work, the main histopatbolueinal change noted

morphologically to be sery similar to that noted in the high-

possible that the change dons riot progress in subchronic ex-
posures.

to the smoke genelation and partividate analysis systems

[32] "Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke
and Female Lung Cancer in Guangzhou, China,"
Y.X. Du, Q. Cha, Y.Z. Chen, and J.M. Wu,
Proceedings If Indoor Air 93 1: 511-516, 1993
"Cigarette smoking is widely accepred as a major risk
for human lung cancer. However, the relationship
between ETS exposure and female lung cancer is being
debated. Since 1980 to 1988, there have been 5,546
cases of deaths from lung cancer in Guangzhou, and
811 cases of them were never smokers. In this group,
552 cases were from ETS exposure [sic]. In order to
ascertain the relationship between ETS exposure and
Jung cancer, some epidemiological analyses have been
performed as follows: (1) Comparisons of medical
histories between ETS and Non-ETS exposure of never
smokers. (2) Conditional logistic regression analyses of
never smokers. (3) A case control study of female never
smokers. (4) ETS exposure and cell type of lung cancer.
All results of these studies demonstrated that exposure to
ETS had no association with female Jung cancer."
"[R]esults [of one analysis] suggest that fresh veg-
etables act as a protective factor against lung cancer,
whereas contact with toxic substances increases the risk
of lung cancer. It is worth noting that in females,
indoor air pollution and situation of kitchen [sic] are
risk factors for lung cancer. However, the [sic] respira-
tory disease. ETS exposure, living conditions, and
familial history of cancer, exerted no effect whatsoever
on female lung cancer.... In the case of males, besides
cigarette smoking, the major risk factors were related to
occupational exposure."
"The OR of ETS exposure is between 0.61-1.62,
showing that spousal smoking, measured either by
daily cigarette consumption, or the duration of smok-
ing, is not a risk factor for female lung cancer."
"The results indicated that no differences in cell types
were observed between the exposed and non-exposed
groups in both males and females. In other words,
exposure to ETS is not to be [sic] etiologically linked to an
increase in epidermoid carcinoma of hit] lung emcee"
"Our studies showed that exposure to ETS had no
associared [sic] with lung cancer, but it does not mean
that ETS had no harmful [sic] to human health."
[331 "Involuntary Smoking in the Restaurant Work-
place: A Review of Employee Exposure and
Health Effects," M. Siegel, Journal of he American
lifedicalAssociation 270(4): 490-493, 1993
"This review assesses the potential health hazard of
ETS exposure for bar and restaurant employees. There
are two questions considered. First, what is the relative
exposure to ETS for bar and restaurant employees
compared with employees of other businesses and with
individuals who live in a home with a smoker? Second,
does ETS exposure in bars and restaurants produce an
elevated lung cancer risk among these workers? To
answer the first question, published indoor air quality
data for bars, restaurants, offices, and residences were
reviewed. To answer the second question, the
cpidemiologic studies of lung cancer risk in food-
service workers were reviewed."
"The mean restaurant ETS constituent concentra-
tions are between 1.6 and 2.0 times higher than those
in the office workplaces studied, and 1.5 times higher
than levels in homes with at least one smoker present.
Me-2/1 concentrations of ETS constituents in bars are
3.9 to 6.1 times higher than in the office workplaces,
and 4.4 to 4.5 times higher than in the residences."
"Six studies have examined lung cancer risk in food-
service workers, controlling for active smoking and
other potential confounding variables, One of these
was a historical cohort study that examined occupa-
tional lung cancer mortality. Five were case-control
studies that included incident lung cancer cases."
"Taken together, these studies suggest that there is an
excess lung cancer risk of approximately 50% (range
10% to 90%) among food-service workers compared
with the general population, controlling for active
smoking. In the two studies that examined bartenders
and other food-service workers separately, this excess
lung cancer risk was found for both groups of workers.
Thus, it appears that there is an elevated lung cancer
risk in both bar and restaurant workers that persists
after controlling for active smoking."

PRIVILEGE AND HEALTH — WHAT IS THE
CONNECTION?
ANYONE who followl,the medical literature knows
that "socioeconomic stat4s" is a powerful determinant
of health. In current Jargort, socioeconomic status re-
fers to a mix of factors that shape a person's rela-
tive social advantage It is usually gauged I
-i1CCHILC,
education, profession, or some combination of the
three, but no one knows exactly which factors deter-
mine health, much less how they do so. It does not
seem to be simply a matter of the privileged having
better access to health care. Nevertheless, in study
after study socioeconomic status emerges as one of
the most important influences on mortality and mor-
bidity.
This issue ot' the journal contains several articles
that touch on thc connection between socioeconomic
status and health. Pappas et al report that in 1986
Americans with a yearly income of less than $9,000
had a death rate three to seven times higher (depend-
ing on race and sex) than those with a yearly income
of $25,000 or more. Americans who had not graduated
from high school had a death rate two to three times
higher than those who had graduated from college.
This gap in mortality between the relatively advan-
taged and the disadvantaged is very large — larger
than the gap due to many other well-known risk fac-
tors, including cigarette smoking.2 And it has been
growing wider.
Morbidity, too, is greater among the poor. In 1991,
7 percent of Americans with incomes below $10,000
reported themselves to be in poor health, as compared
with less than 1 percent of those with Incomes over
$35,000.3 A study in New York Guy showed that the
group with the lowest incomes was about four times as
likely to be hospitalized as the highest-income group
— a disparity not accounted for by an increased inci-
dence of trauma or substance abuse.' In fact, the dis-
parity was especially striking for certain medical ill-
nesses that are particularly amenable to management
outside the hospital, including asthma and diabetes
The poor were nearly eight times as likely to he hospi-
talized for these illnesses as were those with higher
incomes, and they had more severe disease at the time
of hospitalization.45
So closely does socioeconomic status correlate with
health that it confounds the interpretation of much
clinical research. For example, studies of the effect of
passive smoking= childhood asthma are uninlerpret -
able unless an attempt is made to control for socioeco-
nomic status. Without such control, it is impossible to
know whether the increased prevalence of asthma in
the children of smokers is really because of passive
smoking or because smokers are more likely to be poor
and poverty itself is associated with a higher preva-
lence of asthma. Similarly, studies of the Wed of lead
exposure on intelligence are confounded by socioeco-
nomic status The children of well-educated parents
are more likely to do well on IQ tests and are also less
likely to be exposed to lead. Unless the parrots' educa-
tion is considered in research on this subject, then,
it is impossible to know wheiliei lead exposure af-
fects IQ directly or whether the connection is through
another correlate of socioeconomic status Indeed,
if the direct effect of a variable under study - •
for example, passive smoking or exposure to lead — is
small, and the effect of socioeconomic status is large,
it may be very difficult to correct for socioeconomic
status adequately.' In such instances, stratifying sub-
jects in only a few groups according to income or
education may not be sufhcieni. To eliminate entirely
the confounding effect of socioeconomic status may
require stratifying subjects into a great many sub-
groups.
Yet, despite the importance of socioeconomic status
to health, no one knows quite how it operates. It is
perhaps the most mysterious of the determinants of
health. Income, education, and pi ofession are not like-
ly to influence health directly. Instead, these factors
are almost certainly proxies for other variables that
have a direct impact on health. But what are these
variables? Most relevant studies attempt to control for
such obvious ones as cigarette smoking and heavy al-
cohol consumption, both of which are more frequent
among the disadvantaged. And the increased frequen-
cy of trauma and substance abuse among the poor
cannot explain the increased morbidity and mortality
from other causes. One can imagine a host of other
influences such as diet, stress, exposure to infec-
tious agents or toxic chemicals -- that are related to
socioeconomic status, but there is very little evidence
to point to any of' them as a major cause of the health
difference between the advantaged and the disadvan-
taged. We also do not know whether the protective
effects of high socioeconomic status apply at the upper
levels of privilege, or whether there is a threshold
above which increasing wealth and education no long-
er matter.
Many assume that since black Americans are in
general poorer and less well educated than whites, the
differences in health among socioeconomic classes
largely reflect racial differences. Elsewhere in this is-
sue of the Journal are two studies that bear on this
question. In the study by Keil et al.,' education was
more strongly associated than race with mortality
from coronary disease And Guralnik et al." found that
education was more strongly associated than race with
the life expectancy of a group of older Americans.
Except for a few special conditions that affect black
Americans disproportionately, such as hypertsusion,
the poorer health of black Ames icans probably rams
other correlates of lowes socioeconomic status rather
than race itself.
How much of the better health of the privileged is
accounted for by better access to preventive and early
health care is not clear. Arguing against access as a
major determinant of health is the fact that in other
Western countries, such as the United Kingdom,
there are similar disparities in health among socioeco-
nomic classes," though its these countries access is pre-
sumably universal. The results of the Physicians'

not the modest protective 'value of aspirin, but the
exceedingly low overall risk ofrdeath from cardiovas-
cular disease in the subjects, regardless of whether
they took aspirin. Their mortality limn this cause was
only 12 percent that of age-matched men in the gener-
al population. It is unclear whether this remarkably
low risk reflected simply the fact that the subjects had
high socioeconomic status or whether it also reflected
the fact that they were physicians — and therefore in
some way took better care of themselves and had bet-
ter access to care than, say, lawyers or others of sum-
lar socioeuonomic status.
Elsewhere in this issue of the Journal, Hurowitzn
also speaks to thc issue of socioeconomic status and
health. He cautions against expecting too much from
reform of thc health cal e system without inure funda-
mental social and economic reform, and he is critical
of our tendency to view the effects of socioeconomic
hardship as purely medical matters—an approach he
considers both expensive and ineffective. I agree that
we are too quick to "medicalize" many social ills. For
example, we "treat" drug abuse, as well as ldeptonia-
nia, compulsive gambling, and a host of other "co-
dependencies." A recent television advertisement for a
health care business even promised to "help" men who
batter their wives. As Horowitz urges, it may be time
to reverse this tendency to medicalize, and to be more
ready to regard medical illness as the result — direct
or indirect — of søciaJ factors. Certainly, there can be
little doubt that research on the connection between
health and socioeconomic status — given the strength
of this connection — would yield important informa-
tion about the pathophysiology of disease.
Even so, I do not agree with Hurowitz that we need
to establish a "National Institute of Social Health" to
study the social factors influencing health. To do so
would suggest that we can separate social from indi-
vidual factors far better than we can. The truth is that
we would have little basis for distinguishing the pur-
view of the new institute from that of the others in the
National Institutes of Health. Furthermore, to bu-
reaucratize our emerging appreciation of the impor-
tance of socioeconomic status to health might be to
suggest that medical care had become somehow less
important. But there will always be illness that re-
quites medical care. The fact that some illness has a
socioeconomic basis and is therefore theoretically pre-
ventable does not diminish the need for treatment or
palliation. Although medical care may nut greatly in-
fluence the overall mortality arid morbidity rates in
large populations, for individuals it can not only he
lifesaving, but also mean the difference between a life
of well-being and one of suffering.
Dealing with the social causes of disease and re-
sponding to its medical effects arc not mutually exclu-
sive. We should do both. People already burdened by
poverty and lack of education should not also carry a
disproporuonate share of illness Americans live in a
society that tolerates great disparities in wealth and
privilege. The social and political costs are enormous.
We are now learning that the medical costs are also
very high.

IDIOPATHIC MEMBRANOUS
NEPHROPATHY — TO TREAT OR NOT TO
TREAT?
IN 1860 Dr. _Jacob Bigelow, a former president of
the Massachusetts Medical Society, published Nature
in Disease, a compilation of essays that encouraged the
medical profession to understand the natural toucse of
disease and to rest the value of therapeutic measures
by using the scientific method. In an essay entitled
"On the Treatment of Disease," he wrote: "In self-
limited diseases, our treatment must be of the expect-
ant character. It consists in doing what we can for the
comfort and safety of the patient, avoiding useless and
troublesome applications, watching against accidents
and complications and waiting for the salutary oper-
ations of nature."' In this issue of the Journal, Stidep-
pati et al. reaffirm the importance of these insightful
comments in their study of the natural history of idio-
pathic membranous nephropathy.2
During the past quarter-century the field of renal
pathology has emerged from a Babel of loosely de-
scriptive terminology to become a system of classifica-
tion that has provided a firm basis for the design of

. -
smoke (EIS) Which will be observed in the case-control study. Dee primary ai
Of this study is to validate the non-smoking status of the study subjects by
direct interview of the spouse (say. husband) to verify whether the smoking
habits AS reported by the case-control subjects ucre correctly referred to.
The secondary aim is to estimate the aggregation factor, i.e.. the degree of
association of the smoking habits of spouses.
In addition, it has been decided that. whenever possible, a small numbe
of controls should be reintervieved using the tore questionnai.te on passive
smoking it order to obta.in an estimate of the repeatability (uithin-subject
agreement) on the basic information asked on smoking status and EIS exposure
Finally, it has been agreed to collect urine samples from controls to
measure cotinime in order to bave An objective marker of smoking status. Vhf
will provide an estimate of the proportion of present smokers wrongly
classified as non-mmokers and will make it possible to estimate and correct
for the bias due to Active smoking in the ail for ETs.
DESIGN
a)
Validation of non-smoking status by spouse interview
For the purpose of validating the non-smoking status of the indez stud3
subjects. and for assessing the Aggregation factor, the attached quest
naire will be administered to:
- the spouses of All non-smoking lung cancer cases,
- the spouses of an equally sized sample of the non-smoking controls.

A spouse is the preferred choice: children, siblings and ether relatives
may also be questioned. At the end4of the interview with the index
subject (case or control). ask for permission to interview the spouse or
other next-of-kin and for the telephone number. Try to interview the
next-of-kin immediately follouifng the interview with the index subject in
order to prevent any exchange of information between the two intervieus.
Interviews may be conducted via the telephone. In any case, the exact
1

• .
•
•
In order to eStimate the aggregation factOr between spouses smoking
habits. information should be collected on:
i) smoking habits of spouses of non-smokers
Li) mmoking habits of spouses of smokers.
These data will be used in a two by two table as follows:
Husband smoker
Wife smoker
Ad alb/
Aggregation ,,,and
_

interviewed subjects
Husband smoker
The aggregation factor can be computed separately after stratification in
ruo strata depending on whether the information was derived from the wife
or the husband. In the absence of reporting bias. the two aggregation
factors should be equal (or compatible with random fluctuation).
The information regarding the smoking habits of the spouses of 'non-
smokers' can be derived from the non-smoking controls already included io
the case-control study.

INSTeucTIONG  FOR URINE SAMPLE COL!.ECTION
SAMPLE COLLECTION
a) Sueolies 4
Urine collection cups. traisfer pipettes_ 4 vials for shipment and
storage (3-5 mi). plastic bags:for storage of the vials. a styrofoam shipping
container and labels for the samples will be bought by each centre_
b) Sample Collecti6n
The worker in charge of collecting urine semples must be a non-smoker, to
as to avoid couiaminaminn of the collected uriue sampies by nicotine during
handling- Labels with the same subject identification number should be fixed
to the vials containibg urine and to the questionneire-
A dispOsable urine collection cup should he used for each subject. Ee
certain that a new cup and lid is used for each parson- Neu. clean cups are
necessary to ptutect both the subject and the sample from contamination.
To avoid suhctitution. it is Absolutely aecessary that the sample of
urine Should bib freshly obtained. The subjects shoUld Sc assured that any
amount of urine they provide will be an adequate sample.
C) Tranefer and Freezing of Urine Sample
Transfer of urine to vials and all preparations for shipping must be
performed by a non-smoker.
Transfer two (2) ml of urine to each of the 4 small vials which are to be
Sent to I&R.0 using plastic transfer pipettes- The additional amount of uriue
may be stored in small or larger vial3 in the collaboreting centres, if
freezer space is available at -80"C (or -20"C) and kept for future additional
analyses. Please attempt to make this transfer in a clean, non-polluted
environment. Remind the handler that human body fluids can constitute a
serious biohazard s.nd to avoid contamination of the person preparing the
shipment.
After the small urine samples have been rrAnsferred. make cerrain that
identification labels Are attached to each of the samplee. Wrap a piece of
transparent tape around eAch container to protect the label during shipment.
Place all containers standing upright in a freezer at louer rhea O'C until
enough samples have been collected for shipment_
566405783

-
1.2-Feh-1990
All samples should be frozen within 21- hours following collection. Please
make every possible at--empf to see rhat4this is done and that sample s are not
allowed to sit out at room temperature for extended periods. Fresh samples
will remain stable for up to 8 hours, following collection, but warm
temperatures should be avoided if at all posssible.
It is suggested that. if urine collection takes place in the home, inter-
viewers
carry small insulated 'picnic type has with cold packs in them and
that they place the samples in 'a refrigerator and subsequent freezer as
quickly as _possible. Transfer of samples to the centre freezer-shoUld be
'carrked ouc at low temperatures. such that samples-which heve- been frozen will
not defrost. and recently collected samples which are chilled (but not yet
frozen) will not get warm.
The large container. used as the urine collection cup. should contain the
reMSinder of the urine sample after the small aliquots have been removed. This
lirger sample should be frozen and kept in the collaborating centre as a
reserve for further analyses.
SHIPMENT TO XARC
Place 5 kg of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) into the styrofoam shipping
container with the frozen urine cups. Ensure that all samples are frozen solid
before they are placed in with the dry ice. or the sudden change in
temperature will crack the plastic containers_
Place the list of sample ID numbers in a plastic beg to ensure that
dampness in the container does not blur the numbers and then place it with the
vials on top of the dry ice. The recommended amount of dry ice should be
sufficient for 413-72 hnurs Of transit time. Seal the box with heavy packing
tape and place the pre-printed shipping label on the box-
Shipment Procedures
Eight to ten days before the actual shipment you should send a telex or
telefax to Dr Riboli at LAC to notify of the impending shipment. The telegram
should read as follows (or similar):

Chris,
I thought you might find this ET S questioner from IA-PC intere5tint.j. I
have not yet studied it in detail but after a quick review I noted some
interesting points;
- It is somewhat complex, particularly if the responder j.s;
expected to fill it out.
- Cases would be almost certain to view the questions differently
than controls resulting in differences in recall and responses.
- Much of the information requested would Le nearly impossible to
recall accurately.
- Even if E(n interviewer were used, I don't Enpw how they could
be "blind" to who are the cases vs the controls.
- Insufficient information is collected about confounders such as
diet.
- Overall. I found that reading an actual questioner was very
Scott.
illustrative of how many things can go wrono in rase control
study and how many biases could be introduced by the
information collection process.

Introduction
There are many potential sources of indoor air pollution, including chemicals emanating
from building materials, furnishings, and consumer products; gases from combustion
appliances like space heaters and furnaces; and biological contaminants from a variety of
sources. However, field studies, controlled experiments and mathematical models have
shown that Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is one of the most widespread and
harmful indoor air pollutants and is a major contributor to particulate indoor air pollution.
The smoke emitted by cigarettes, cigars and pipes contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of
which are known carcinogens and toxins. These are inhaled by smokers during the process
of smoking, and by nonsmokers who breathe the EIS emitted into the air. The breathing of
Ers by nonsmokers is called "passive," "involuntary," "sidestream" or "secondhand"
smoking.
The effects of smoking on smokers have been examined in over 50,000 studies conducted
over the last 25 years. These have shown that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, chronic
obstructive lung disease, and coronary heart disease. According to the Surgeon General,
cigarette smoking is the chief avoidable cause of death in the United States, with the
number of premature deaths due to smoking estimated at 390,0001 annually. The Office on
Smoking and Health reports that smoking causes more premature deaths every year than
cocaine, heroin, alcohol, fire, automobile accidents, homicide and suicide combined.2
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presumes that there is no such thing as a
risk-free exposure to a carcinogen. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, EPA believes
that any exposure to a cancer causing agent—regardless of level—increases the risk of cancer.
The fact that active smoking causes lung cancer, therefore, suggests that nonsmokers
exposed to ETS are also at risk for lung cancer, although at a much lower level than
smokers.
Recently, scientific studies have examined the link between ETS and lung cancer. In 1986,
two major independent reviews examined the impact of ETS on public health.
Commissioned by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) under the Surgeon General, and by
the National Research Council (NRC) at the request of EPA and PHS, both groups arrived at
the same conclusion: exposure to ETS significantly increases the risk of lung cancer.
Moreover, there was agreement that ETS exposure substantially increases respiratory illness
In children and aggravates the conditions of people with heart disease.
In 1990, EPA completed a risk assessment of the health effects of ETS. The report examined
the 24 epidemiological studies which have studied the level of risk of lung cancer from
exposure to ETS. The risk assessment reached the following conclusions:
According to the EPA classification of carcinogens, ETS is A Group A Carcinogen_ Group A
Carcinogens are agents known to cause cancer in humans.

The number of ETS-attributed lung cancer deaths in U.S. never-smoking adults is
approximately 2,500 annually. The excess number of ETS-related deaths in former smokers
is estimated at about 1,300 annually.
The evidence linking ETS exposure to Increased lung cancer incidence can not be attributed
to chance.3
There are also serious non-carcinogenic effects from ETS. In particular, there is a strong
association between ETS and respiratory effects on children and there is mounting evidence
of heart disease mortality in nonsmokers from passive smoking. The evidence of Erb lung
cancer and respiratory disease risks is particularly strong since ETS has been demonstrated
to cause health effects at low levels of exposure.
The public health implications of these findings are significant because of the large numbers
of people exposed. Tobacco smoke is virtually ubiquitous in our society. Studies show that
between 26%4 and 29%5 of the US. adult population smokes. This is a decline of almost
one-third since 1964.6 However, the people who continue to smoke smoke more than they
did before. According to the National Research Council, reported cigarette consumption
among heavy smokers has increased from 273 to 30 cigarettes per day, and the number of
heavy smokers has steadily increased over the past 30 years. As a result, the number of
cigarettes smoked each year in the United States has increased, and "the nonsmoker who
has close contact with a smoker may be exposed to greater amounts of smoke in 1985 than
in 1955.7
The magnitude of the problem led the Surgeon General to state in 1986 that "the scientific
case against involuntary smoking as a public health risk is more than sufficient to justify
appropriate remedial action, and the goal of any remedial action must be to protect the
nonsmoker from environmental tobacco smoke."5 Heeding his words, many nonsmokers
have become concerned about their exposure to ETS, and many businesses and
governments are now taking steps to protect them from it.
This publication is designed to help the non-expert understand the technical basis for
smoking restrictions and to provide guidelines for implementing them. It explains the
physical and chemical nature of bib, how ETS exposure occurs, how it is measured, and the
health effects of exposure. It examines passive smoking in the workplace and other sites,
and examines legislative, legal, financial, educational and labor concerns. It includes
different strategies for reducing exposure to smoking at the workplace along with case
studies of policies that have been successfully implemented. Finally it contains a list of

Key Points
What is ETS?
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is primarily a combination of sidestream smoke from
the burning end of the cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and exhaled mainstream smoke from the
smoker.
It contains over 4,000 chemicals, at least 43 of which are known human or animal
carcinogens.
Measuring ETS in the Air and Body
Researchers have found that ETS diffuses rapidly through buildings, persists for long
periods after smoking ends, and represents one of the largest sources of indoor particle
pollution.
Certain constituents of tobacco smoke can be found in the body fluids of nonsmokers who
were exposed, indicating that they have inhaled and retained ETS.
Health Effects of ETS
According to the EPA classification of carcinogens, ETS is classified as a Group A
Carcinogen. Group A Carcinogens are agents known to cause cancer in humans.
ETS exposure is associated with respiratory problems and an increased frequency of ear
infections in young children.
ETS may aggravate the conditions of people with existing heart and respiratory disease.
Since there is no established health-based threshold for exposure to ETS, and since EPA
generally does not recognize either a no-effect or safe level for cancer causing agents, the
Agency recommends that involuntary nonsmoker exposure to ETS be eliminated wherever
possible.
How Big is the Risk from ETS?
The number of ETS-attributed lung cancer deaths in US. never-smoking adults is
approximately 2,500 annually. The excess number of E1S-related deaths in former smokers
Is estimated at about 1,300 annually.
Reducing Exposure to ETS
Nonsmokers ETS exposure can be eliminated by: creating enclosed, separately ventilated
smoking rooms with direct external exhaust, or prohibiting smoking indoors.

ETS exposure can be reduced through a number of techniques. These include: creating
separate walled areas for smokers and nonsmokers with a shared ventilation system,
creating separate unwalled areas for smokers and nonsmokers, air cleaning, air washing
and time separating smokers and nonsmokers. The effectiveness of each of these techniques
in reducing E lb varies.
Regulating Smoking and ETS
The number of communities with legislation restricting smoking jumped from 90 in 1985
to 450 in 1989.
Most ordinances give higher priority to protecting nonsmokers from environmental
tobacco smoke over smokers preference to smoke.
Developing Effective Smoking Policies
To succeed, smoking policies need the support of top management.
Policies should be developed with employee and labor union input.
Whenever smoking policies are introduced, smoking cessation programs should be made
available to employees who want to quit.
Cost Savings Related to ETS Reduction
Organizations that have implemented policies that restrict or eliminate ETS-exposure
report some cost savings.
Public Attitudes Toward ETS
86% of all Americans (smokers and non-smokers) believe ETS is dangerous to their health.
69% of all Americans (smokers and non-smokers) are annoyed by ETS.
77% of all Americans (smokers and non-smokers) believe that smokers should not smoke
in the presence of non-smokers.

CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS ETS?
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is primarily a combination of sidestrearn smoke from
the burning end of the cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and exhaled mainstream smoke from the
smoker.
Sidestream Smoke (SS) is the smoke emitted by the burning end of cigarettes, pipes and
cigars between and during puffs. The stronger a smoker inhales, the more sidestrearn
smoke is emitted. For the average smoker, approximately 55% of the cigarette is burned
between puffs, making sidestream smoke the largest constituent of ETS.9
Mainstream Smoke (MS) is smoke inhaled by the smoker. Smokers exhale approximately
18%10 of the smoke they inhale, making exhaled mainstream smoke the second largest
constituent of ETS.
Gases that escape through the cigarette paper as the cigarette is being smoked account for a
relatively small percentage of ETS.
ETS is a cloud of fine particles and liquids suspended in gases. For the purposes of studying
it, scientists have broken it into two components, called "phases." The particulate phase
contains particles approximately one-tenth of a micrometer and larger. Particles that are
smaller than one-tenth of a micrometer are called the gas phase. Together, the particles in
the particulate and gas phases of ETS contain over 4,000 chemicals, at least 43 of which are
known carcinogens.11
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAINSTREAM AND SIDESTREAM SMOKE
ETS differs from mainstream smoke in two important ways: particle size and chemical
make-up.
Particle Size
The particles in ETS are smaller than those in mainstream smoke. This allows them to be
absorbed deep into the small air sacs of the lungs.
The average size of mainstream particles is relatively large—seven tenths of a tnicrometer.12
Because the smoke is very concentrated, the particles tend to dump together, forming even
larger particles as they are inhaled. As a result, they are deposited mainly in the mouth and
larger airways of the smoker's lungs.
Most sidestrearn particles, on the other hand, are much smaller—between two and four
tenths of a micrometer.13 The smoke is dilute, and the small particles tend to be absorbed
deep into the small air sacs of the lung, where approximately 10% of them remain. The dose
absorbed is small, but after absorption, the chemicals circulate widely in the body, tending to
remain in the body longer than mainstream smoke in active smokers.14

Chemical Make-Up
Sidestrearn smoke contains more toxic and carcinogenic chemicals than mainstream
smoke, although the concentrations are much higher in active vs passive smokers.15 An
analysis of 15 Canadian cigarettes showed that their sidestream smoke contained 3.5 times
the amount of tar and 6.6 times the amount of nicotine than was present in their
mainstream smoke.% A study compared the amounts of nine toxic compounds in the
mainstream and sidestream smoke of four US. cigarettes. In all nine chemicals studied, the
amount in sidestream smoke was significantly higher than the mainstream smoke leve1.17
The tar and nicotine sidestream yields do not decrease proportionately with the cigarette
mainstream yields.18 This means that manufacturers efforts to reduce tar and nicotine
consumption for smokers by introducing filtered and low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, has
not reduced involuntary exposure to these chemicals. In some cases, it may have actually
increased it.
OTHER CONTAMINANTS
In addition to chemicals that are intrinsic to tobacco, or caused by its burning, cigarette
smoke may also contain pesticides and herbicides. The Surgeon General has observed that
although there has been a reduction in the use of agricultural chemicals, it is fairly certain
that commercial tobaccos contain up to a few parts per million of DUI', DDD, and maleic
hydrazide; fewer than 20 percent of these contaminants are transferred into the smoke
stream."19
It is difficult to document exactly which contaminants or additives are present in his
because there are no government requirements for the disclosure of tobacco constitutents.
The identity of all contaminants, along with other compounds added in the manufacturing
process, is regarded as confidential information by cigarette manufacturers.20
HAZARDOUS CONSTITUENTS IN ETS
Many of the chemicals in ETS are known carcinogens, mutagens, toxins or irritants.
Carcinogens and Mutag ens
Carcinogens are agents capable of causing cancer. Mutagens are agents capable of causing
permanent, often harmful, changes in cells, some of which may lead to cancer. F. 15 has
both.
Of the 99 compounds in tobacco smoke that have been studied in detail, at least 43 are
complete carcinogens,21 each able on its own to cause the development of cancer in humans
or animals. Other ETS constituents are tumor initiators, capable of carrying out the first
steps in cancer development. Still others are tumor promotors, able to accelerate the
development of cancer.

ETS also contains chemicals that are co-carcinogens, able to cause cancer when combined
with another substance. It contains cancer precursors, compounds that pave the way for
formation in the body of other carcinogenic chemicals. And it contains other compounds
that damage the cilia, or cleansing hairs, of the lungs, making them less able to clear the
lungs of deposited tars. This allows cancer-causing chemicals to remain.
In his 1979 report, the Surgeon General cites 27 known tumor initiators, three groups of
tumor promotors, and 18 compounds or groups of compounds that are co-carcinogens as
known components of tobacco smoke.22
Sidestream smoke is known to have significantly higher concentrations of carcinogens and
mutagens than mainstream smoke. For example, the tumor initiators N-nitrosamines are
found in quantities up to 100 times greater in sidestreain smoke.
Chemical analysis of the smoke from pipes, cigars and cigarettes indicates that carcinogens
are found in similar levels in each. Experimental studies have shown that smoke
condensates from pipes and cigars are equally, if not more, carcinogenic than those from
cigarettes.24
Toxins and Irritants
In addition to its carcinogenic constituents, li lb contains a variety of other chemicals that
are harmful to humans. Examples include:
Carbon monoxide is a gas that interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen.
Carbon monoxide levels increase when smokers are present, adding to the body burden of
carbon monoxide from other environmental sources.
Hydrogen cyanide interferes with the action of the tiny cilia hairs in the lungs. It is also an
extremely strong twig irritant and more potent than carbon monoxide in its ability to starve
one of oxygen.
Ammonia is a powerful eye and respiratory irritant.
Nicotine, a poison, is also the addictive agent in tobacco smoke.
Sidestream smoke has been documented to contain more of each of these compounds than
mainstream smoke.25

CHAPTER / Measuring ETS in the Air and Body
Historically, when researchers studied environmental air pollutants, they focused on large
outdoor sources such as industrial emissions, toxic wastes, and auto exhaust. They used
stationary monitors to determine what pollutants were present, and in what quantities.
Recently, however, scientists have turned attention indoors. Because many people spend
up to 90% of their time inside, indoor air forms the largest part of what we breathe. Pius,
even small amounts of indoor pollutants may cause as much risk as vast amounts of those
materials outside.26
Recent technological advances make the measurement of many indoor pollutants possible.
Sensitive monitors enable scientists to analyze the chemical and particulate composition of
indoor air. Sophisticated portable monitors permit them to monitor an individual's
personal airspace as he or she moves through numerous environments over several hours
or days. And detecting pollution-derived chemicals in an individual's saliva, urine, or
blood enables scientists to confirm exposure. Scientists are now using these techniques as
well as mathematical models to study ETS-exposure.
DEFINING EXPOSURE
Nonsmokers' exposure occurs when they encounter ETS-polluted air, The extent of their
exposure is determined by how long they breathe the polluted air, and by the concentration
(or density) of ETS in the air. Concentration is affected primarily by the number of smokers
present, the rate at which they smoke, the ventilation conditions in the room or building,
and how large a space it is.
When people are exposed to ETS, some smoke particles remain in the body while others are
exhaled. Those that remain are called the dose. A person's dose is affected by the amount
of smoke to which he or she is exposed, the duration of exposure, and breathing rate.
People engaged in physical activity, for example, will inhale and retain larger quantities of
air than those who are motionless. Currently, scientists are able to measure a person's
exposure to ETS and the dose of certain constituents, but are not yet able to directly measure
the total dose of smoke inhaled and retained.
ASSESSING ETS EXPOSURE
Researchers have several ways of assessing ETS exposure.
Air monitors measure the amount of certain constituents of smoke in a given air space_
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
56640580S
11

Biological markers are indicators of exposure in a person's body fluids.
Questionnaires ask -people about their exposure.
Mathematical models calculate the degree of exposure that is likely in a given airspace.
Since 1951, approximately 50 studies have been done of ETS concentrations in buildings.
Using these methods, researchers have found that ETS diffuses rapidly through buildings,
persists for long periods after smoking ends, and represent one of the major sources of
indoor particle pollution.
Air Monitoring Studies
Air monitoring is done two ways. Stationary monitors are used to measure the amount
and types of air-borne pollutants in a particular space; personal monitors are portable gauges
carried by individnals to measure the pollutants they are exposed to as they move through a
variety of environments over a period of time_
However, neither type of monitor measures all the components of ETS because the number
of constituents is too large. Instead, surrogates are used, chemicals that are accurate
indicators of the presence and quantity of EIS. The most commonly used surrogate is
respirable suspended particulates (RSP). RSP refers to the tiny particles, small enough to be
inhaled deeply into the lungs, that are present in all air. These particles come from dust,
cooking, household chemicals and many other objects in our environment_ However,
studies show that where smoking is permitted, b1 is the major contributor to RSP in
indoor air.27
Stationary air monitor studies have compared RS? levels in the homes of smokers and
nonsmokers. They found that each smoker generates 25 to 35 micrograms of R.SP per cubic
meter of air (g/m3). Homes with two or more heavy smokers frequently exceed the
federal 24-hour outdoor particle standard of 260 ug/m3. In homes with heavy smokers,
short-term particulate concentrations of 500 to 1,000 ugirri3 are not uncommon.2a
Studies of public buildings duplicate these findings_ Levels in non-smoking buildings, such
as churches, libraries and museums, had low levels of RSP. By contrast, restaurants, bars
and bus stations, where smoking is permitted, had RSP levels ten to twenty times as high.29 30
The highest RSP levels were found in designated smoking areas, where the level of RSP
con-elated with the number of cigarettes smoked. One office building had RSP levels of 11
jig/m3 in its nonsmoking offices, and 520 ug/m3 in a smoking lounge.3I In the smoking
section of an airplane, R.SP levels were five times higher than in the nonsmoking section,
reaching 1,000 pig/m3.32
Personal air monitor studies found similar results. Nonsmokers who were exposed to
smokers recorded significantly higher levels of RSP than did those who were not exposed.
12

This was true for children with smoking parents (compared to children of nonsmokers),
and for adults exposed to smoke both at home and at work.31 34
Biomarker Studies
Some of the constituents unique to tobacco smoke can be found in the body fluids of people
who were exposed to smoke, indicating that they have inhaled and retained ETS. Scientists
use these chemicals as biomarkers, indicators of ETS exposure. They are not direct
measures of the total dose of ETS the individual inhaled.
Cotinine is the most commonly used biomarker. Since it is totally unique to tobacco, it is a
reliable indicator of ETS exposure. Nicotine breaks down in the body into cotinine, a
chemical easily measured in blood, saliva and urine.
Studies show that cotinine levels are higher in people who report they have been exposed
to tobacco smoke than in those who report they have not. Studies have shown a
relationship between cotinine levels and ETS exposure.35 Cotinine levels show that infants
absorb nicotine from passive smoking as well as from breast:a-111k36 Cotinine has also been
measured in the urine of people who were unaware they had been exposed. In fact, in
several British studies, nearly all nonsmokers had measurable cotinine levels, regardless of
reported exposure. Positive cotinine concentrations in three out of four nonsmokers,
including persons reporting no exposure to tobacco smoke in the measuring period (up to a
few days, depending on the body fluid tested), demonstrate the ubiquity of ETS exposure in
nonsmokers.37
Other Surrogates
While RSP and nicotine are the most widely used surrogates for ETS, researchers have
studied other surrogates as well.
Air monitor studies have shown nicotine levels considerably greater in homes with
smokers than in homes without.38
Benzene, a hazardous air pollutant which is regulated in outdoor air by EPA because it
causes leukemia in humans at occupational levels, has been found at average levels SO%
higher in homes with smokers than in homes without.39 People exposed to ETS at work
over 50% of the time, have show-n significantly higher breath concentrations of benzene
than those exposed less often.40 For smokers, cigarettes are the greatest source of benzene
exposure in the environment For passive smokers, Lis is a significant source of benzene
exposure.

Questionnaires
Surveys or questionnaires are frequently used to determine ETS exposure. They typically
inquire about smoking habits of family, friends and co-workers and the level of the
resulting ETS exposure. Asking people about their EIS exposure has several potential
limitations. First, questionnaires usually only can address short term exposure and do not
provide an indication of dose over a lifetime. Second, most questionnaires have limited
the discussion of ETS exposure to the home, while a large amount of the exposure may take
place away from the home (at work or in public places). Third, it is often difficult to
measure and quantify ETS exposure at work. Even with these limitations, questionnaires
have proved to be an effective tool to distinguish between populations that receive a high
level of exposure and those that receive a smaller level.
Mathematical Models
Mathematical models involve measuring and analyzing a number of factors to determine
total ETS exposure from a given space. The first step in the process requires measuring with
monitors the concentration of various EIS constituents. These pollution levels are
combined with information concerning the amount of time an individual will spend in the
area to develop an average level of exposure. Finally, the calculations review the factors
which control the contaminant levels in the space (these may include the number of
cigarettes smoked, amount of ventilation in the space, etc.). Mathematical models have
been developed and tested for accuracy and have proved to be a reasonable way to estimate
ETS exposure.

CHAPTER 3: Health Effects of ETS
Studies show that for healthy adults, the acute respiratory effects of short-term ETS
exposure can vary from none to moderate irritation. Regular long-term ETS exposure can
cause chronic irritation and lung cancer. Susceptible sub-populations (those with special
sensitivity to ETS) are at greater risk Researchers are also examining the effects of ETS on
the cardiovascular system and other parts of the body.
IRRITATION
Whereas short-term visitors to a smoking area may be annoyed by tobacco smoke odors,
nonsmoking occupants of the area are more likely to complain about burning, itchy eyes,41
This occurs when the water-soluble chemicals in tobacco smoke dissolve in the liquid of the
eyes, causing reddening, itching and tearing. For many people the effect is annoying; for
some it can become incapacitating.
ETS can also cause irritation in the nose and throat when the smoke's water-soluble
chemicals dissolve there, irritating the mucous membranes. The result is generally a sore
throat or cough. Other short-term effects of ETS exposure include wheezing, dizziness,
headaches or nau.sea.42 Studies in both laboratories and real-life situations show that
irritation increases with exposure, although a few studies have suggested that irritation
levels off after about an hour.43
LUNG CANCER
Since active smoking causes lung cancer, it is reasonable to believe that exposure to ETS
might also increase a person's risk of developing the disease. To investigate that possibility,
several researchers have conducted epidemiological studies of exposed nonsmoking
populations.
In early 1981, researchers in Greece reported a significant increase in lung cancer among
nonsmoking women married to smokers.44 At about the same time, similar results were
reported from a methodologically different study in japan,45
These three studies fueled serious concern about the lung cancer risks of ETS. As a result,
In the mid-1980's, the Surgeon General and the National Research Council each convened
scientific panels to study the matter further. Their reports were issued in 1986. Both
concluded that passive smoking causes lung cancer.
The Surgeon General based his conclusion on three facts: active smoking causes lung
cancer; there are qualitative similarities between ETS and mainstream smoke; and
epidemiological studies show a positive association between lung cancer deaths in
nonsmokers and ETS exposure. The Surgeon General stated, "Involuntary smoking is a
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
15
566405813

cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers." He added, "In examining
a low-dose exposure to a known carcinogen, it is rare to have such an abundance of
evidence on which to make a judgment."46
The National Research Council reached the same conclusion in a somewhat different way_
They found that laboratory studies show that it is biologically plausible for ETS to cause
cancer in human cells, and that epidemiological studies confirm a link between lung cancer
In nonsmokers and ETS exposure.47
In 1989, a formal risk assessment of lung cancer and ETS was undertaken by EPA's Offices of
Research and Development and Air and Radiation. After review and analysis of 24
epidemiological studies,48 they concluded that ETS is a Group A carcinogen according to the
EPA's classification of carcinogens. Group A Carcinogens are agents known to cause cancer
In humans. This comprehensive review also concluded that the epidemiological evidence
linking ETS exposure to increased lung cancer incidence cannot be attributed to chance.49
Since there is no established, health-based threshold for exposure to Bib and since EPA
generally does not recognize either a no-effect or safe level for cancer causing agents, the
Agency recommends that exposure to ETS be eliminated wherever possible.
The number of lung cancer deaths attributable to bib exposure is discussed in the next
chapter.
RESPIRATORY DISEASE
Respiratory disease has also been linked to EIS exposure in children. EIS may also cause
respiratory disease in adults. Several studies have reported small declines in lung function
in nonsmokers exposed to ETS, but whether ETS exposure alone would cause chronic
obstructive lung disease in otherwise healthy adults is unclear.
IMPACT ON SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATIONS
The strong irritants in ETS may exacerbate conditions in especially sensitive individuals.
These include children and the approximately 10% of the population suffering from
asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and chronic sinusitis. Also potentially at risk are people
with allergies, other respiratory conditions, heart disease and circulatory disease. All of
these conditions may be aggravated by exposure to ETS. These are discussed in more detail
below.
CHILDREN
Studies have docuniented that 54% to 75% of American children live with smoking adults. SO
Children, therefore, represent an extremely large exposed population. In fact, exposure to
ETS may begin in utero since fetuses of nonsmoking mothers have shown absorption of
16
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405814

FIS constituents.51 ETS exposure continues after birth, as infants drink breast milk
contaminated with ETS constituents and breathe his polluted air.
While tobacco smoke absorption can be dangerous for adults, it is especially so for children.
Children have been shown to absorb more nicotine from ETS than aduIts,52 they are
exposed over a longer period of time, and their developing respiratory systems may be
especially vulnerable to toxic damage.
The most common health effects in children are symptoms of respiratory irritation and
infection. Children of smoking parents wheeze more, cough more, have more phlegm, and
have higher rates of pneumonia and bronchitis than children of non-smoking parents.
They are also hospitalized more often for these respiratory infections. The level and
frequency of illness correlates with the number of cigarettes smoked by the mother
(presumably a father's smoking has less bearing on his child's health because he typically
spends less time with the child).
EIS exposure in children is associated with mild impaired lung growth. Some studies
suggest that bib exposure in utero may alter the growth pattern of the fetal lung, which
may cause increased respiratory infections in later life.53 And children with at least one
smoking parent seem to have slower growth of lung function than do children with
nonsmoking parents.54
A third effect is ear infections. Young children exposed to ETS have higher rates of chronic
ear infections and middle-ear effusions than children who are not expot.ed.56
While the specific effects of ETS on children are still being investigated, the general
conclusion is clear. In the words of the National Research Council, "it is prudent to
eliminate ETS exposure from the environments of small children."56
ASTHMATICS
Some people with asthma report that exposure to EIS increases their symptoms, and
several studies have documented this effect. However, other studies have shown little
difference between asthmatics' reactions to ETS and that of healthy nonsmokers. At this
time, the data are too limited to draw conclusions.57 58
PEOPLE WITH HEART DISEASE
Some studies have shown that ETS can aggravate the conditions of people with existing
heart disease. By increasing the levels of carboxyhemoglobin arid carbon monoxide in the
blood, ETS decreases the ability of the heart to contract and pump.59 This raises the blood
pressure of people with heart disease.60 A complete analysis of the data linking ETS and
heart disease has not been conducted by EPA.

566405-S15

PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES
People with allergieS (as well as the allergy-prone) frequently develop allergic-type reactions
to EIS: headache, sore throat, wheezing and nausea_ This has prompted researchers to
investigate the possibility of a tobacco smoke allergy; however, it is still too early to know if
such an allergy odstsfii
OTHER POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS
HEART DISEASE
The data available at the present time are insufficient to conclude that ETS causes heart
disease but it appears that some association may exist. Although several epidemiological
studies62 that have examined the relationship between ETS and heart disease have
concluded that ETS exposure is associated with increased risk of heart disease, the
relationship between the two is still a subject of debate within the scientific community. As
noted above, EPA has not conducted a full review of this literature.
CANCER AT OTHER SITES
A small number of studies have examined the relationship between ETS exposure and
cancer at sites other than the lung. At this point the data are too limited to be conclusive.
However, some studies of nonsmoking women found higher cancer rates among those
whose husbands smoked than among those whose husbands didn't. These cancers
included brain tumors and nasal sinus cancers,63 genital., breast and endocrine cancers,64 and
cervical cancer.65 Studies of children have found increased risk of cancer in those whose
parents smoke,666 and a study of infants found that those whose mothers were exposed to
ETS while pregnant had a higher risk of developing brain tumors. 69 Additional research is
needed in this area.

CHAPTER 4: How Big is the Risk From ETS?
To estimate the number of nonsmokers who die from lung cancer each year due to ETS
exposure, EPA conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of ETS in 1989-90 entitled
"Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Assessment of Lung Cancer in Adults and Respiratory
Disorders in Chi1dren".70 The study reviewed and analyzed the data from 24
epidemiological studies on ETS and lung cancer, including those that have been done since
the 1986 reports of the Surgeon General and the National Research CounciI.71
THE EPA RISK ASSESSMENT
The risk assessment focused on never-smoking women rnarried to smokers because this is
the most studied group. The report estimates that approximately one-fourth of all lung
cancer deaths in never-smoking women are due to ETS exposure. This equals
approximately 1,750 deaths annually in U.S. never-smoking women from all ETS exposure.
The data on ETS-related lung cancer deaths in never-smoking males are sparse. The
available evidence suggests that the individual risks for men and women are comparable,
although the total number of men never-smokers exposed to ETS is considerably smaller
than the number of exposed never-smoking women. This translates into approximately
750 deaths in US. never-smoking males annually from all ETS exposure. If the same risks
hold for ex-smokers, EIS exposure would be responsible for an additional 1,300 deaths
annually for both sexes.
Therefore, the total number of all ETS attributed lung cancer deaths in nonsmoking U.S.
women and men is approximately 3,800 annually. The number of EIS-attributed
lung-cancer deaths in current smokers has not been estimated, nor has the effect of home
vs. occupational or social exposures been compared.
COMPARING RESULTS WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES
In a recent review n of nine previous risk assessments on EIS, estimates of lung cancer
deaths in eight of these were in dose agreement, averaging approximately 5,000 deaths per
year in nonsmokers exposed to Frs. These assessments were done in different ways, some
quantifying ETS exposure in terms of "cigarette equivalents" and using mathematical
models to extrapolate down to environmental levels. The EPA risk assessment estimates
the percent of the risk attributable to EIS, based on actual studies at true environmental
levels. This eliminates the need for mathematical extrapolation models. EPA estimates of
attributable risk, approximately 25% of all nonsmoker lung cancer deaths, is also consistent
with those of others, including the NRC.

PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
Based on EPA's estimate that approximately 2,500 never smoking adults and
approximately1,300 former smokers die from lung cancer each year as a result of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke, ETS is an important public health concern. Because of the
ubiquity of tobacco smoke in our society, even a small increase in the risk of lung cancer
from exposure to ETS translates into a significant health hazard to the U.S. population.

PART LI
ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE: THE SOLUTIONS
A variety of strategies have been developed to mitigate nonsmokers exposure to ETS.
These strategies vary in effectiveness, implementation cost and inconvenience to smokers.
The following chapters explore issues to consider in policy development, the range of policy
alternatives and successful implementation strategies to reduce or eliminate involuntary
ETS exposure.
Chapter 5: REDUCING EXPOSURE TO ETS
Nonsmokers' ETS exposure can be eliminated by creating enclosed, separately ventilated
-smoking rooms with direct external exhaust, or by prohibiting smoking indoors. ETS
exposure can be reduced through a number of techniques including separate walled areas
for smokers and nonsmokers with a shared ventilation system, separate unwalled areas for
smokers and nonsmokers, air cleaning, air washing and time separation. The effectiveness
of each of these strategies will be reviewed in this chapter.
Chapter 6: REGULATING SMOKING AND ETS
There are federal, state and local regulations that have an impact on ETS exposure. There
have also been lawsuits concerning involuntary exposure to ETS in the workplace and suits
by smokers to establish a right to smoke. This chapter examines the impact of legislation
and litigation on involuntary exposure to ETS.
Chapter 7: DEVELOPING EttECTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
The workplace may be the greatest source of ETS exposure for many nonsmoking adults.
However, ETS exposure can be effectively reduced or eliminated from the workplace with
carefully developed smoking policies. This chapter discusses strategies for developing
effective policies.
Chapter 8: COST SAVINGS RELAi hi) TO ETS REDUCTION
Organizations that introduce smoking policies report a variety of cost savings. This chapter
reviews cost savings directly and indirectly related to reducing EIS in the workplace.
Public opinion tends to support smoking restrictions in public places. This chapter reviews
the major public opinion surveys in this area.

CHAPTER 5: Reducing Exposure to ETS
The ability of ETS to spread quickly through the air makes it virtually ubiquitous in indoor
spaces where smoking is permitted. However, b IS exposure can be eliminated or reduced
through a number of techniques. These include: prohibiting smoking indoors, creating
separate smoking lounges with separate ventilation, creating separate walled areas for
smokers and nonsmokers with a shared ventilation system, creating separate unwalled
areas for smokers and nonsmokers, air cleaning, air washing and time separating smokers
and nonsmokers. The effectiveness of each of these techniques in reducing ETS varies.
This chapter discusses each of these techniques. How they can be integrated into successful
smoking policies is discussed in Chapter 7.
Prohibit Smoking Indoors
The most effective way to eliminate ETS exposure for nonsmokers is to prohibit smoking
indoors. This is also, generally, the least expensive method of eliminating ETS from indoor
air because it doesn't require changes to the existing ventilation system and may also reduce
long term energy costs. However, a smoking prohibition may be inconvenient to those
smokers who continue to smoke and must leave the building to do so.
Part Three of this guide contains case studies of organizations that successfully prohibited
smoking in the workplace.
Create Separate Smoking Lounges With Separate Ventilation
Creating enclosed smoking areas with separate ventilation can eliminate nonsmokers'
exposure to ETS without forcing people who want to smoke to go outside. A smoking
room can be designed to protect nonsmokers from the health risks of ETS and to provide
smokers additional ventilation while they are inside the room.
To be properly ventilated, a smoking room should meet three requirements:
The smoking room should have a separate ventilation system. This means that air from
the room should be immediately exhausted outside rather than being recirculated through
the building. The average building recirrulates the vast majority of its air supply.
The room should have at least 60 cubic feet per minute (dm) of outdoor air per smoker to
control ETS odors. The average for the typical office is 5-20 din of outdoor air, which is
inadequate to effectively reduce the level of ETS when smokers are present.
The room should be slightly negatively pressurized to prevent backstreaming of smoke into
the nonsmoking areas of the building. This means that the air pressure inside the room
22 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405820

should be somewhat lower than the air pressure outside. The average building is positively
pressurized.
Part Three also contains examples of organizations that have successfully established
separately ventilated, indoor smoking rooms.
Create Separate, Walled Areas For Smokers and Nonsmokers With a Shared
Ventilation System
A common mitigation strategy is to create separate areas for smokers and nonsmokers, each
walled off from the other. This may reduce nonsmokers ETS exposure. However, it does
not eliminate ETS pollution. As long as the two spaces share a ventilation system, their
occupants will breathe the same air. Polluted air from the smoking rooms will be
recirculated to nonsmoking areas.
A second problem with this strategy is that ETS diffuses easily through doorways and
windows. Therefore the smoke will not remain in the room, but will seep into neighboring
nonsmoking spaces 73
Create Separate, Unwalled Areas For Smokers and Nonsmokers
This is the most common mitigation strategy, and is often employed in restaurants.
Smokers and nonsmokers share one space which is divided into "smoking' and
"nonsmoking" areas.
This arrangement may be preferable to seating smokers and nonsmokers side by side,
because it reduces the amount of ETS in the immediate area. However, it does not
eliminate ETS exposure. ETS particles spread readily throughout a room, polluting
nonsmoking as well as smoking areas. For this reason, the Surgeon General has stated that
simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but
does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke:74
Air Cleaning
"Air cleaning" is a generic term that refers to three general types of devices.
Mechanical filters: these use a filter to trap particles. There are two main categories of
mechanical filters. Flat filters, which will efficiently collect large particles but remove only a
small percentage of respirable-sized particles and pleated filters which generally attain
greater efficiency in capturing respirable-sized particles.
Electronic air cleaners: these trap charged particles using an electrical field.
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405821
23

Ion generators: these use static energy to charge the particles-Once charged the particles are
attracted to walls, floors, table tops, draperies, occupants, and other surfaces. Some ion
generators contain a collector to attract the charged particles back to the unit.
Some of the newer machines on the market are referred to as "hybrid" devices. They
contain two or more of the types of 'particle removal mechanisms discussed above.
Mechanical filters, for example, may be combined with an electrostatic precipitator or an ion
generator.
Air cleaners can be in-duct devices, installed within a building's heating, ventilating and air
conditioning CHVAC) system, or can be free-standing, portable devices_ The effectiveness of
air cleaners in removing pollutants from the air depends on both the efficiency of the
device itself (the percentage of the pollutant removed as it goes through the device) and the
amount of air handled by the device.
Portable air cleaners vary in size and effectiveness in pollutant reduction capabilities. They
range from relatively ineffective table-top units to larger, more powerful console units. In
general, units containing either electronic air cleaners, negative ion generators, or pleated
filters, and hybrid units containing combinations of these mechanisms, are more effective
than flat filter units in removing ETS particles.
It should also be noted that although some air-cleaning devices may be effective at reducing
ETS particles, many of the gaseous pollutants are not effectively reduced.75 In addition, gases
may be reemitted from tobacco smoke particles trapped by the air cleaner, since the particles
are primarily liquid.76
Air Washing
Air washing is a process in which air is sprayed with water to increase its humidity. Some
people report that washed air smells fresher than unwashed air, perhaps because some of
the water-soluble particles in ETS are dissolved. As a result, washed air may need less
ventilation to control tobacco odor. But washing does not significantly reduce the number
of rrs particles in the air and its gaseous pollutants, so it is relatively ineffective for
mitigating the health effects of ETS exposuren
Time Separating Smokers and Nonsmokers
Time separation is a strategy that seeks to mitigate ETS exposure by having smokers and
nonsmokers use the same space at different times. While this will reduce nonsmokers'
acute exposure, it will not eliminate it because of the persistence of ETS. ETS particles cling
to room surfaces and remain in the air for several hours after smoking has stopped. People
entering a space where smoking occurred several hours earlier will often still be exposed to
ETS particles and gases.

SIDEBAR
EXAMINING YOUR VENTILATION SYSTEM
The type of smoking policy you adopt may be influenced by the design of your ventilation
system. Before you decide on a policy, talk to your landlord or building engineer to learn
how the system works and how it can best meet your needs. Some things to look at are:
VentiLation umts. In a central ventilation system, air recirculates through all floors of a
building: you breathe your neighbors air. Can you create separate ventilation zones for
your area?
Smoking room options. Are certain areas better suited for smoking rooms than others?
Requirements. Does your city or state have different ventilation requirements for smoking
and nonsmoking spaces?
Cost What would it cost to establish separately ventilated smoking rooms? What are the
on-going energy costs of maintaining them?
Maintenance. To function properly, ventilation systems must be cleaned and serviced
regularly. Is your system being adequately maintained?

"Handicapped Rights" Suits
Some smoke-sensitive employees have sued for relief under the Federal Rehabilitation Act
of 1973. According to the Act, a "qualified handicapped individual" is entitled to
"reasonable accomodation" for his or her disability. In two cases, employees claimed that
sensitivity to tobacco smoke qualified them as disabled, and asked that smoke be eliminated
from their worksites. In the case of Pletten v. Department of the Army, g8 the Merit
Systems Protection Board ruled that Pletten was handicapped as a result of his smoke
sensitivity, but that because he moved around during the day, the only effective way to
eliminate smoke in his worksite would be to prohibit smoking throughout the facility.
That, the Board felt, would be "undue hardship" for his employer. In the case of Vickers v.
Veterans Administration,a9 the court held that Vickers was handicapped as a result of his
smoke sensitivity, but that the employer had already made "reasonable accomodation" to
his handicap by creating a separate smoking area and installing additional ventilation.
Although both plaintiffs requests were denied, these cases are important because they
establish the precedent of nonsmokers qualifying as disabled under the Rehabilitation Act.
The Act covers all federal employers, federal grant recipients, and federal contractees with
contracts over $2,500.
Disability Retirement Suits
In 1982, Irene Parodi, who is asthmatic, was awarded disability retirement benefits by a
federal appeals court because her employer, the federal government, had failed to provide a
safe, smoke-free work environment. The court held that a person with an "environmental
limitation"—that is, someone whose environment limits her ability to perform—can
qualify for such benefits. In a settlement, the government paid Ms. Parodi $50,000 and
granted her a civil service disability annuity.
This case established two precedents. First, a federal appeals court recognized that ET'S in
the workplace can prevent an otherwise normal and productive employee from performing
his or her job. Second, it recognized that such an employee, in effect, becomes disabled and
may be entitled to disability benefits.%
Workers Compensation Suits
In 1985, Marlene Rkhie, an administrative assistant in the Oregon State Executive
Department, won her claim against the state in a Workers Compensation hearing. The
ruling found that Ms. Richie had suffered a "bona fide occupational illness" because of ETS
in the department's central offices. The order rejected the state's assertions that no
compensation was due Ritchie because she was unusually sensitive to smoke and was a
"chronic complainer" about her health. "She has reason to be a chronic complainer about
her health owing to the fact that she actually is having health problems caused by
on-the-job cigarette smoke," the hearing referee wrote in his opinion. Her unusual
30 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405824

sensitivity to smoke was. not a valid argument against compensation, the referee held. An
employer takes an employee as the employee is found," he concluded.91
In 1980, Helen McCarthy left her job with the Washington State Department of Social and
Health Services. After long-term exposure to ETS at work, she had developed chronic
obstructive lung disease, and filed for Workers Compensation. The state rejected her claim,
arguing that her disease was neither a work-related injury nor an occupational disease, the
two situations compensible under Workers Compensation. McCarthy then sued her
former employer for negligently failing to provide a safe and healthy workplace. The trial
court dismissed the case, stating that employers are immune from suits under Workers
Compensation. However, the Court of Appeals reversed that decision on the grounds that
since McCarthy's injury was not covered by Workers Compensation, preventing her from
suing her employer would unjustly deprive her of a remedy. The State of Washington
appealed the verdict and the case went to the state Supreme Court. The high court
• unanimously confirmed the opinion of the Appeals court and again remanded the case to
the trial court. McCarthy and the State of Washington reached a settlement shortly before
the case was scheduled for trial. 92
Unemployment Benefits
At least six states—New Jersey, Minnesota, Washington, California, Iowa and Idaho—have
granted unemployment benefits to nonsmokers who quit their jobs because they were
forced to work in smoke-filled offices.
SUITS BY SMOKERS
At the same time that some nonsmokers have found protection in the courts, several
lawsuits have indicated that smoking in public is not a legally protected right. In 1982,
Stanley and Elka Diefenthal, were denied seats in the smoking section of an airplane
because the section was already full. They sued the Civil Aeronautics Board, claiming their
right to smoke had been abridged. The trial court dismissed the case and the Diefenthals
appealed. The Court of Appeals refuted their claim, stating that smoking sections on
airplanes are created for the protection of nonsmokers, not the benefit of smokers.93
A few smokers have filed discrimination suits against employers who failed to hire them
because they smoked. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, firefighter Grusendorf filed suit against the City
when it prohibited smoking by firefighters on or off the job. He claimed the rule violated
his constitutional rights of liberty and privacy. The Court upheld the City rule, finding that
the fire department had a legitimate interest in the health of its employees.%
In a 1988 action, a job applicant in Minnesota claimed discrimination when an employer
refused to hire him because he smoked. The employer argued that the smoker was
undesirable because of his increased disability risk. The applicant appealed to the state
Human Rights Commission which ruled that the employer's refusal to hire could fall
within its definition of discrimination if it was based solely on concern about the

employee's disability risk Refusals are not discriminatory if. the employer can prove that
the smoker's habit would impair his job performance or injure other employees. Because
the applicant's job involved working alone, the employer could not make either of those
claims. As a result, the Commission issued an executive order mandating that his
application be accepted.%

CHAPTER 7: Developing Effective Smoking Policies
As concerns grow about the health effects of LIS, more organizations are implementing
smoking control policies. A 1988 study by the American Management Society Foundation
found that 60% of surveyed businesses had smoking policies in place and another 8% were
currently considering a policy. This was up from the 16% of businesses that had policies in
1980. In addition the survey found that 25% of the businesses surveyed prohibited smoking
at work This was up from 14% in 1987.96

Organizations with successful policies find that they require careful thought and planning.
Who is involved in shaping the policy, how it is implemented, and the support given to
smokers are elements critical to its success. Failure to carefully consider these factors can

A FIVE STEP PROCESS
Policy development andimplementation is a five-step process. Attention to each step
should produce a policy that is fair, well-received and comprehensive. The five steps are
management review, situation analysis, strategic planning, implementation and
evaluation.
Management Review
Goat:
• to acquire information on the smoking issue and its impact on the organization and to
garner management support for developing a policy
To educate executive management on the smoking issue, information should be gathered
on the smoking issue and how it affects the organization. Include information on
employee complaints concerning smoking, the health effects of ETS, legal considerations,
and the financial implications of adopting or not adopting a policy. (A list of resources
appears at the end of this book)
Situation Analysis
Goat:
• to gather background information on the organization's attitudes and needs in relation to
a smoking policy
Once management has decided to pursue a policy, it should select and charge a Policy
Development Team_ This team will take primary responsibility for developing and
Implementing the policy. It can be made up entirely of managers, or can be an
employee/management committee. It should include smokers, nonsmokers and
ex-smokers, and union representatives, whenever labor unions will be involved.
Smoking policies, like any change in working conditions, are often seen as a mandatory
subject of labor negotiation. Failure to include labor representatives in the policy
development and implementation process has lead to litigation. Some courts have sided
with unions. Overturning the policy. Others have permitted policies to stand, citing the
overriding health and safety concerns.
The first task of the Policy Development Team will be to gather data about the
organization's needs and attitudes in relation to a smoking policy. Organizations often take
the following steps: conduct an employee survey to assess employees' attitudes toward
smoking in the workplace and toward possible restrictions; conduct a facilities survey to
examine the building's ventilation system (and areas that could be used as designated
smoking rooms), and review existing policies to see which might be affected by smoking
restrictions (e.g. break policies, hiring policies, discipline policies and employee benefits).
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405828

Strategic Planning
Goal:
■ to define the smoking policy
Where smoking is permitted is only one aspect of a policy. Many other considerations must
also be addressed:
- how will employees be educated about the policy?
- will stop-smoking classes be provided?
- will the company pay for the stop-smoking classes?
- how will the policy be enforced?
- how will policy violations be handled?
- will the new smoking policy impact hiring and break policies?
- will smoking be permitted in company vehicles?
- will it be permitted by visitors?
- will cigarette machines be allowed on company property?
- what will the signage needs be for the new policy?
In reviewing policy options, the Team should also talk to organizations and individuals
that have successfully implemented workplace smoking policies in order to learn from
their experiences.
Implementation
Goa!:
• to implement the policy smoothly, with minimum disruption and maximum employee
support
Successful policies begin with carefully planned announcements. Explain the reasons for
the policy as well as its stipulations. Make sure employees understand that this is a health
and safety issue, not a crusade.
Announce the policy 90 days before it is to take effect The 90 days between the policy's
announcement and its inauguration are critical. Use this time to educate employees and to
provide support to smokers. This will also give employees time to adjust and express their
concerns.
Organizations have successfully used employee newsletters, seminars, question and answer
sessions, telephone hotlines, and no-smoking signs to tell employees about the new rules,
about cessation programs, and about how to get more information. Present the policy as a
"win/win" effort Don't pit smokers against nonsmokers. For the policy to succeed, it must
be seen as benefitting the whole organization, not one group. Top management should be
vocal in its support of the policy.
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
35
5654058Z9

Offer mechanisms for employees to comment on the policy. Train managers in responding
to the comments. Also make a special effort to listen to smokers. Get them involved in
creating designated smoking areas and planning cessation programs. Many smokers will
use the policy as an incentive to quit. Cessation programs help them with this goal and
promote acceptance of the policy.
Evaluation
Once the policy is implemented, the Policy Development Team, along with other
employees as needed, should conduct a comprehensive evaluation. The review should
review the following questions:
- how was the policy received by both smokers and nonsmokers?
- were there policy violations? if so, how were they handled?
- how was the employee education campaign received?
- how many employees enrolled in smoking cessation programs?
- how many employees quit smoking or reduced their smoking level?
- has the organization reviewed the cost containment possibilities created by the new
smoking policy?

CHAPTER 8: Cost Savings Related to ETS Reduction
The Office of Smoking and Health in its 1990 Report to Congress reviewed the annual
financial impact of tobacco use and reported, "the total economic impact for an 50 States was
over $52 billion: $23.7 billion in direct morbidity (illness) costs, $10.2 billion in indirect
morbidity costs, and $18.5 billion in indirect mortality costs." The report concluded that
"with the sum of State economic costs exceeding $52 billion, the economic impact of
smoking can be put at some $221 per person each year. Thus cigarette smoking has an
economic impact on every American, whether or not he or she smokes."96
The exact contribution of ETS to the overall economic impact of smoking has not been
determined. There has been relatively little research in this area and most of the studies
that have been conducted only minimally document the direct and indirect costs of ETS.
Rather, the studies review the excess costs borne by companies as a result of having smokers
on the payroll. 9911:01011CQ103104105106107
A recent study of business executives asked if smoking increased costs for their companies.
69% of the executives surveyed felt that smoking increased medical and insurance
premiums, 44% felt that smoking increased maintenance costs, and 37% responded that
smoking increased absenteeism costs. 21% of those surveyed responded that smoking had
no effect on their company's costs.lce

This chapter will summarize what is known about the costs attributed to ETS and about
possible cost savings as a result of ETS reduction. Much of the information in this chapter
is self-reported by organizations, or anecdotal. More research is needed to quantify if, and
where, cost savings are possible related to Bfb-
DIRECT COST SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF ETS REDUCTION
When smoking takes place inside a facility, ETS can have a direct impact on the health and
productivity of nonsmokers and the maintenance of equipment and furnishings.
Nonsmoker Health and Productivity
Nonsmokers regularly exposed to ETS can experience a variety of impairments, from mild
irritation to cancer. Al the low end, these impairments can reduce a worker's productivity
or cause absenteeism; at the high end, they can produce large medical or legal claims.
Pacific Northwest Bell prohibited smoking in its facilities in 1985 (its case study appears in
chapter 10). Following the implementation of its policy, the company documented savings
In health care costs. These included a 13% decrease in clinic visits for respiratory problems,
a 20% drop in respiratory- related absences lasting three days or more and a decrease in
clinic visits for headaches and sinus problems. Pacific Northwest Bell attributes a
substantial amount of these savings to the improvement in air quality based on its
smoke-free policy.
Maintenance and Repair
As discussed earlier, components of ETS adhere to indoor surfaces, which can cause them to
discolor and smell. As a result, costs for cleaning, repainting and replacing furnishings can
be higher when smoking is permitted. ETS can also damage sensitive equipment, such as
computers and laboratory equipment. Companies that fail to keep their equipment free of
EIS, therefore, can have higher equipment damage and depredation costs.
Unigard Insurance prohibited smoking in its office areas and received a $500 monthly
discount in janitorial costs in one facility. Its cleaning vendor reported that there were
significant time savings due to not having to dump and clean ashtrays, reduced time
dusting desktops, reduced time spent edging and shampooing carpets, reduced maintenance
on upholstered furniture and a reduced window cleaning frequency. 109 Pacific Northwest
Bell also reported a reduction in damage to office property, such as bums in rugs and
upholstery. The organization also found that overall cleanliness in its facilities improved.
INDIRECT COST SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF ETS MITIGATION
The Surgeon General's 1986 report observed that "a stringent smoking policy can decrease
the number of smokers within an organization." Companies that implement policies report
that this is the case. Pacific Northwest Bell found that following the introduction of its
38 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405832

smoking policy, almost 25% of its smokers quit smoking and 61% of the remaining smokers
report that they now smoke less. Reducing the number of smokers or eliminating smoking
entirely can result in lowered costs to a company in each of the following areas.
Fire and Accident Insurance
Organizations that prohibit smoking can bargain for lower fire and accident insurance
premiums. Research shows that smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to be involved
in fires110 and up to twice as likely as nonsmokers to be involved in accidents.1I1 As a result,
fire and accident insurance premiums where smokers are present can be higher.
Group Health and Disability Insurance; Productivity and Absenteeism
Insurance companies frequently offer discounts on individual health insurance policies to
nonsmokers. Similar discounts are now beginning to be offered to group policy holders as
well. Because implementation of a smoking policy in a business generally results in a
reduced number of smokers on the payroll, this can result in lower health insurance
premiums. King County Medical Blue Shield of Washington offers up to a 15% discount in
health insurance costs to organizations that prohibit smoking and have fewer than 10%
smoking employees. (They have also agreed to pay for 75 percent of the cost of smoking
cessation programs for subscribers.)
Discounts are also available in disability insurance premiums. Nonsmoker discounts range
from 3 to 14%, with the industry average at 8%. Some insurance providers impose a
surcharge on smokers. The average smoker surcharge varies from 10 to 14%, with the
industry average at 13%.
The effects of smoking on absenteeism have also been documented. Repeated studies have
shown a 33% to 45% greater absenteeism rate among smokers than nonsmokers.112 In 1979,
the Surgeon General reported that Si million work days are lost per year due to smoldng.113
This works out to approximately two days per smoker.
Studies show that smokers lose work time to the smoking ritual as well as to minor
smoking related impairments, such as reduced attentiveness. Estimates of productive time
lost vary from eight 114 to 55115 minutes a day.
The 1986 Surgeon General's report stated that "it is generally agreed that employees who
smoke cost their employers more than nonsmoking employees because of excess
absenteeism, increased health care utilization, and reduced productivity. This leads to
greater use of sickness, disability and health care benefits and ultimately higher health
Insurance costs to bu.siness.mis
This was borne out in a study which compared health care utilization differences between
tobacco users and people who did not use tobacco in a large group insurance plan. The
study found that tobacco users had more hospital admissions (124 vs. 76), more total days in

the hospital (800 vs. 381), a higher average length of stay (6_47 vs. 5.03 days), higher average
outpatient payments ($122 vs. $75), and a higher average of overall payments ($1145 vs_
$762). The authors Of this study did observe tobacco use is correlated with other high risk
behaviors, therefore, cost and utilization differences may not be based solely on tobacco
use.117
The correlation between tobacco use and higher health care utilization and higher health
care costs was corroborated by a study at Pacific Bell, which found that the annual health
related costs (disability, absence, and health) of smokers averaged $593 more than the same
costs for nonsrnokers.118

CHAPTER 9: Public Attitudes Towards ETS
Surveys of public attitudes about smoking have been done since 1964. They have been
performed by major national polling organizations (the Roper Organization, Gallup Polls,
and Louis Harris and Associates) for the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health, the American
Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, the
Tobacco Institute, and other groups.
Regardless of sponsor, the polls show consistent results. They reflect increasing public
concern about the dangers of ETS, and increasing approval of restrictions on smoking in
public places and the workplace. These increases occur for both smokers and nonsmokers.
The Surgeon General's report observed that changes in attitudes about smoking in public
appear to have preceded legislation, but the interrelationship of smoking attitudes,
behavior and legislation are complex.
Public perceptions about risk and the degree of acceptance of restrictive measures has a
profound impact on the technical aspects of mitigation strategies. Therefore a series of key
findings from public opinion polls are included.
The following chart summarize the results of some of these surveys.

PART III
CASE STUDIES
The following chapters profile smoking policies in a variety of organizations and settings
Each case study examines a policy's development, implementation and evaluation. All of
the policies described have been in effect for at least three years.
Across all the case studies, certain factors stand out as critical to a policy's success. These
include: demonstrated support for the policy by executive management, establishment of an
Indoor or outdoor designated smoking area, development of a mechanism for gathering
employee feedback, implementation of a comprehensive employee education effort,
Introduction of stop-smoking programs for smoking employees, participation of labor in
policy development and implementation, and development of a policy that applies equally
to all employees.
Chapter lit SMOKING POLICIES IN THE PRIVATE WORKPLACE
Pacific Northwest Bell (facilities in Washington, Oregon and Idaho) implemented a policy
prohibiting smoking in its facilities in 1985.
Honeywell Corporation (Minnesota) established separately ventilated designated smoking
rooms in its Minneapolis-area facilities in 1987.
Chapter it SMOKING POLICIES IN GOVERNMENT FACILITIES
The Indian Health Service (over 200 locations throughout the US.) in 1984 implemented a

CHAPTER 10: Smoking Policies in the Private Workplace
According to the Surgeon General, for adults living in a household where no one smokes,
the workplace is the greatest source of exposure to ETS.119 However, several concerns make
some private employers reluctant to institute smoking policies:
Angering Employees
Many managers fear that adopting a smoking policy will create dissension in the company
and cause employees to leave. However, studies of companies that have implemented
policies show that employees often favor the clarity that a smoking policy will provide and
that smoking employees generally lose their resentment within the first few months.
Enforcement
Many managers are concerned about having to punish smoking policy violators. However,
companies that have implemented policies report few cases of discipline involving
employees smoking at work. Smoking policies seem to be largely self-enforring, with
employees reminding violators of the rules_
Labor Unions
Some companies assume that their unions will automatically oppose smoking restrictions_
However, many organizations find that when unions are involved in developing a policy,
they can be counted among the policy's supporters. Smoking policies are widely seen as a
subject of mandatory negotiation, so labor should be included in their development.
This chapter profiles two corporations that implemented different kinds of policies. Pacific
Northwest Bell prohibited smoking entirely. Honeywell established designated smoking
rooms in its corporate headquarters.
PACIFIC NORTHWEST BELL, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
• Smoking Prohibition
BACKGROUND
Pacific Northwest Bell (PNB) is the telecommunications company serving Washington,
Oregon and Idaho. Now known by the name of its parent company, US. West
Communications, the company employs 15,000 people in over 750 separate buildings.
Among its facilities it counts business offices, substations, central switching offices,
computer centers, construction and vehicle garages, and its 32-floor headquarters building
In downtown Seattle. PN13 employees include linemen, computer technicians, mobile

43

service representatives, mechanics, operators and office personnel. This broad range of
facilities and employees all had to be accomodated in the company's smoking policy.
THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
PNB first began considering a smoking policy in 1983. The primary impetus was employee
complaints. The president, as well as health and safety officers, received frequent letters
from nonsmokers objecting to co-workers tobacco smoke. Because of the growing
awareness of the dangers of ETS, the company was sensitive to these objections. Local clean
air legislation and press coverage also fed their concern for employee safety. To examine
the issue, management convened a Smoking Issues Steering Committee. Comprised of
company and union representatives, smokers, nonsmokers and ex-smokers, the committee
was charged with "exploring alternatives and recommending a policy that was fair and
equitable to all employets."120 121 Over the next two-and-a-half years, the committee
gathered information and studied different approaches to limiting ETS in the workplace.
The committee began by surveying employees. Through an employee questionnaire, they
polled workers on their feelings about smoking on the job and at home, their smoking
status, and their grasp of the issue. The survey revealed that 26% of employees smoked
cigarettes (an additional 2% smoked pipes or cigars) and that employees harbored strong
dissatisfaction with existing smoking conditions. For example, 82% of nonsmokers
indicated they had occasionally been bothered by someone else's smoke. The survey results
reinforced the company's decision to develop a policy; in fact, PNB immediately reduced
the smoking area in all its cafeterias from 70% to 35%, better reflecting the proportion of
smokers. At the same time, they designated all their conference and training rooms
nonsmoking.
Next the committee reviewed the city, county and municipal ordinances regulating indoor
air in the three states in which they operate. The regulations varied. To meet them, the
company felt it needed a simple, but comprehensive policy. To generate some policy
alternatives, they reviewed the smoking policies of other corporations.
Then the corrunittee turned its attention to company buildings. After conducting a facilities
survey, they found that existing ventilation systems were inadequate to meet the needs of
smoking areas. Retrofitting the systems would cost between $5,000 and $80,000 per room, a
prohibitive amount considering the large number of PNB buildings. That finding had a
strong effect on steering the company toward a smoking prohibition.
PNB knew that Labor union support of its policy would be crucial. More than two-thirds of
the employees belong to either the Communications Workers of America or the Order of
Repeatermen and Toll Testboardmen. Without the unions' support, the company would
have had implementation and enforcement problems. To avoid these, they involved
union representatives in shaping the policy. The unions, representing both smokers and
nonsmokers, were in a difficult position. Taking a stand on either side would mean
potentially angering members. To avoid this, they each took a neutral stand on the policy.
44 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CTTE OR QUOTE
566405838

However, they had strong feelings about certain aspects of the policy that would affect all
their members, regardless of smoking status. They felt that in order to be fair, the policy
needed to be completely non-discriminatory: if one area was to be nonsmoking, all should
be. They also felt that if the company were going to require smokers to restrict their
smoking, management should pay for smoking cessation programs for employees, spouses
and dependents. As a result of the discussions, the company agreed to union requests, and
the unions agreed not to support grievances filed by individual employees.
As the committee gathered input and reviewed options, the company allowed individual
work groups to test their own solutions. Groups tried a variety of approach. Some voted
on whether to permit smoking in their area: that left many workers feeling outvoted and
unhappy. Others permitted smoking only during certain hours: that failed when smoke
from a work group next door drifted into their area. Some decided to go smoke-free, but
unknowing smokers would walk through their area, arousing a hostile reaction. Others
asked smokers to rut back that peeved smokers without satisfying nonsmokers. Every
alternative had drawbacks and the company continued to get complaints. As they weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of each, the scale tipped decisively in favor of a
facility-wide prohibition.
One week before announcing the policy, the committee presented it to employee focus
groups. The groups voiced the greatest concern about company commitment and
enforcement. As a result, a memorandum was issued to all directors, asking that they let
subordinates know that all officers—including PNB's president—were totally committed to
the ban. Then, on July 15, 1985, two-and-a-half years after the Steering Committee first
convened, a memorandum was sent to all employees. It said, "to protect the health of PNB
employees, these will be no smoking in any company facility." Three months later the
policy went into effect.
IMPLEMENTATION
Concurrent with the announcement of the ban, PNB began an employee education
program explaining the health effects of Elb and the reasons for the policy. The effort
included the company newsletter, its in-house health and safety magazine and a telephone
"hotline" employees could call with questions or comments.
At the same time the company agreed to reimburse employees, spouses and dependents
who attended a cessation program from an approved list. Individuals were free to choose
the type of program that would work best for them, a choice which appeared to increase
their commitment to succeed_ As a result of the program, 1,541 employees signed up for
classes. Forty percent were still not smoking after a year, and the percentage of smoking
employees dropped from 28% to 20%. In a recent survey evaluating the prevalence of
cigarette smoking, 66% of smoking respondents said it had helped them cut down or quit.
The average smoker had smoked more than 20 years before entering the program, and had
tried to quit approximately five times. The majority of ex-smokers say they feel healthier

since they stopped smoking and that the work environment- has improved since policy
implementation.
EVALUATION
According to a company spokesman, the smoking policy is "one of the most successful
policies PNB has ever implemented." Enforcement has not been a problem: only one
employee violated the policy and received a verbal warning, as part of PNB's normal
progressive discipline program (verbal warning, written warning, suspension and
termination). Today headquarters employees, who work In one of the taller buildings in
Seattle, are well-known for having to go down as many as 32 flights and out the door when
they want a cigarette.
PINTB recently completed a follow-up study on its smoking policy. They conducted a random
sample of 1800 employees with a survey response rate of 89%. The employees were asked
how they felt about the ban on smoking inside company facilities. Seventy percent
responded that the policy was "about right", 18% said the policy was "not strict enough",
and 12% reported that the policy was "too strict". The company reports that 60% of the
current smokers agreed that the ban on smoking in company facilities was "about right.
The company also asked employees about the harmfulness of ETS. Ninety-one percent of
the employees called EIS "definitely or probably harmful, 3% called it "definitely or
probably not harmful", and 6% responded that they "don't know or are not sure".
PNB 'mew that implementing a policy would cost money, but decided early on that they
would rather "invest" that money in employee health than pay the on-going expense of
permitting smoking. After implementing the policy, they systematically measured its
financial impact, and found that it produced substantial cost savings: there are now 13%
fewer visits to company clinics for respiratory problems; there has been a 20% drop in
respiratory-related absences lasting three days or more (this equals a cost savings for
Incidental and disability absences of $111,000) and visits to clinics for headaches and sinus
problems are down. Savings on health insurance are difficult to measure because of the
large number of contributing factors, but based on these statistics the company believes
them to be substantiaL In addition, damage to office property, such as burns in rugs and
upholstery, has decreased, and overall cleanliness has improved.
Offsetting these savings, PNB spent an average of $145 per smoker—less than $250,000—on
cessation classes. They contrast this with the much greater sum it would have cost to
re-ventilate their 750 buildings, and feel they made a wise economic choice to implement a
smoking prohibition.
In fact, they could have reduced their cessation costs further. In their eagerness to provide
customized classes, they offered a wide array of programs. Some (hypnosis and
acupuncture) were less effective than others (group and individual support sessions, and
doctor-prescribed programs). Had the company limited the cessation options, they might
46 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405540

have steered employees to more effective programs and negotiated discounts with program
suppliers.
In evaluating its policy, PNB emphasizes the following points:
PNB's significant employee and union involvement in shaping the policy played a key role
in gaining employee support for the policy.
The comprehensive and free  smoking cessation program for employees, spouses and
dependents played an important role in getting smokers' support for the policy.
HONEYWELL CORPORATION
• Separately ventilated smoking rooms
BACKGROUND
Honeywell Inc., manufacturer of electronics equipment, employs 56,000 people in its 22 U.S.
divisions. The company owns or leases over 400 buildings, including its large corporate
headquarters in Minneapolis, branch offices around the country, and several major
manufacturing plants. Approximately 40% of its facilities are in the Minneapolis area.
THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Honeywell first developed a smoking policy in response to Minnesota's new Clean Indoor
Air Act. The company asked its divisions nationwide to implement policies regulating
smoking. They were to follow the guidelines of the Act and create, at a minimum,
designated smoking areas. In response, some set up smoking lounges; others permitted
smoking everywhere except in designated no-smoking areas. Most company cafeterias were
divided into smoking and no-smoking sections. The company did not recommend
enforcement provisions, and therefore, few divisions had them.
However, as information about ETS grew, employee complaints persisted. Many people
worked in open offices in which smoking and nonsmoking sections were side by side.
Others worked in nonsmoking areas that adjoined dosed smoking rooms from which some
smoke escaped. In response to employee concerns divisions gradually tightened their
policies.
An employee survey was conducted through Honeywell's in-house publication. It asked if
employees favored increased smoking restrictions and 75% said they favored the same level
or greater restrictions. This resulted in a policy to move closer to a smoke free
environment. Smoking was banned from conference rooms, offices and common areas_
This approach resulted in both positive and negative feedback from employees and
management. It was decided that the Minneapolis-area operation would develop a
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
47
566405841

uniform policy for their facilities. Out-of-town divisions were asked to develop and refine
their own policies to best meet their needs.
The task of developing the Minneapolis-area policy was given to the Human Resources
directors of those divisions. This group met for almost a year, talking with union
representatives and examining policy options. Finally, the committee decided on a policy
that would ban smoking from Honeywell buildings and grounds.
IMPLEMENTATION
To ease the transition for smokers, management decided to implement the policy gradually.
Three to four months before the policy was to take effect, it was announced in the company
newsletter. Also announced was a "phase-in" period during which the policy would be in
effect but would carry no penalties. Several months later, in response to considerable
employee concern, the company rescinded the total ban, and created "temporary" smoking
rooms in each building while they re-exmained the policy. Free on-site smoking cessation
programs were already being offered both on and off hours.
After several more months of deliberations, a revised policy was issued for Minneapolis
operations. Honeywell decided to retain the designated smoking rooms as a reasonable
accommodation for all concerned. This time violation penalties were specified;
enforcement would be handled by department managers; penalties would follow usual
disciplinary procedures including reprimands, demerits, verbal and written warnings, and
possible termination.
To accomodate the large amounts of smoke, ventilation in the smoking rooms was
modified. Each room was vented directly to the outside; exhaust fans and air cleaners were
added. The cost of the changes in ventilation was estimated to be a few thousand dollars
per room.
EVALUATION
The new policy is considered successful. 99% of employee smoking occurs in the smoking
rooms, with smokers occasionally reminded by co-workers not to smoke elsewhere. Most
infractions occur on weekends or evenings when the offices are largely empty.
Nonsmokers occasionally complain that smokers get extra break time, but most of the early
discomfort with the policy has quieted down.
The smoking lounges seem to meet the needs of smokers, although they generate
occasional complaints from nonsmokers. When large numbers of smokers are present,
smoke escapes from some of the rooms through the doorway. Workers in adjacent offices
have complained, and in the corporate headquarters building, extra doors were added to
one smoking room to minimize such leaks.

Today, Honeywell feels it has learned valuable lessons in policy development, and is
pleased to have a smoking policy it considers successful. Many of the out-of-town divisions
also have implemented a policy in keeping with their local needs and environment.
In evaluating its policy, Honeywell emphasizes the following points:
Honeywell could have paid closer attention to the needs of smokers.
It should have demonstrated strong management commitment to the policy from the start.

CHAPTER 11: Smoking Policies in Government Facilities
The 16 million Americans employed by federal, state and local governments are subject to
widely different smoking regulations. While some government agencies prohibit smoking
entirely, many restrict it to designated areas and some have no regulations at all Increasing
numbers of agencies are implementing or making smoking policies more stringent_
However, some agencies hesitate to tackle the issue because of the following concerns:
Occupational Variety
Within one government agency, the range of occupations — and work environments — can
be huge. A small city government, for example, may include offices, hospitals, vehicles,
waste facilities, fire stations, public transportation facilities, an airport, and other disparate
sites. Developing a policy that meets the needs of each site can seem formidable. However,
governments have found that when a policy is developed with input from everyone
affected, it can be implemented smoothly and successfully_
Labor Unions
Labor contracts in government can have weaker management rights sections than those in
private business. This can weaken management's position in negotiating a policy.
Government agencies have avoided this problem by bringing unions into the policy
development process early on as a partner.
Layered Decision-Making
Government agencies tend to have slow, layered decision-making processes that can
hamper the development and implementation of new policies. Governments have
streamlined this process by treating smoking policies not as political issues, but as internal
personnel issues.
This chapter profiles the policy development process in two government organizations.
The Indian Health Service prohibits smoking in all of its facilities. The City of Bellevue
created an enclosed, separately-ventilated, designated smoking room.
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE122
• Smoking Prohibition
BACKGROUND
The Indian Health Service (1-IS) is the primary health care provider for approximately one
million Native Americans. Its facilities include 11 area offices, 43 hospitals, 66 health
centers, and over 100 health stations and satellite clinics throughout the United States.
50

THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
In 1983, IHS doctors and administrators began to consider restricting smoking. Their reason
was simple: they wanted to reduce the number of Indians who smoke. They were
supported in this goal by Indian tribal leaders as well as by Surgeon General Koop who
helped them map a strategy. Together they developed the goal of a Smoke Free IHS.
To develop the policy, they formed a Smoke-Free Task Force. The 18 member committee
included administrators, doctors and nurses; Indians and non-Indians; smokers,
nonsmokers and ex-smokers. The Indian representatives were adamant: they would
support a policy only if it were equitable, that is, if it applied equally to Indians and
non-Indians. That meant administrators, doctors, nurses, janitors, food service workers,
patients— everyone working in or using the facilities would have to be equally restricted.
There could be no smoking in private offices, in conference rooms, or in any other areas
off-limit to Indian patients. in effect, the Indian representatives would support only a total
prohibition of smoking in IHS
80 to 90% of the clinical care providers of THS welcomed this as good news. They too
favored a ban. 11-IS leadership; administrators, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc., had
bong recognized the great importance of disease prevention, if the limited annual budget
were to make inroads against the extensive health problems of Native Americans.
Smoking control was essential in disease prevention.
Unlike some other hospital systems where nurses, many of whom smoked, had been
reported as a group to tend to offer resistance to smoking control, the Native American
Nurses Association was one of the first groups to offer support for a total smoking ban. IHS
encouraged this nursing leadership by giving early key roles in the policy planning and
development to nurses and saw to it that later recognition and credit was given to the
nurses.
IMPLEMENTATION
The task force decided that implementation would be handled autonomously by individual
IHS facilities. As a result, implementation was uneven. Some facilities implemented the
ban immediately. Others phased it in over two years, first restricting smoking to a few
areas, eventually banning it altogether. In some facilities, staff and patients were
extensively educated through memos, newsletters and presentations at which employees
could ask questions and voice concerns. In others, education was left to the announcement
memo and signage. Implementation was delayed the longest in a handful of the 200
facilities where there were weaker education programs and where staff felt their concerns
were not addressed.
In contrast with the strong general support from clinicians, the non-clinical care employees,
such as laboratory and maintenance equipment/store room employees tended to be less
appreciative of preventive health measures and were less supportive as a group. Most local
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
51
566405845

community union members were supportive. Of the 19 unions representing IFIS
employees in 25 states, 17 were involved in the early discussions for planning,
development and implementation of the new smoking control policies. However, in two
instances where local hospital administrators did not follow IHS leadership instruction for-
proper involvement of the unions, there was a challenge by local unions.
In one of these instances (Tahlequah, Oklahoma) a union grievance was taken through
Federal Court to the US. Federal Labor Relations Authority, September 1986. This was one
year after the hospital and the IHS had already successfully implemented their smoking
bans at 200 facilities in 25 states on a system-wide basis.
The Federal Judge's ruling dated July 23, 1987 dismissed the union grievance as without
validity. However, an appeal by the union has resulted in a 1990 reversal of the 1987 ruling
to say that the II-1S local facility at Talhequah, Oklahoma was in error in not negotiating
with the union before implementing the smoking ban as a "fait accompi." In response to
this ruling, the Department of Health and Human Services of the U.S. Government, as the
department responsible for the Indian Health Service, has pointed out that IHS failure to
properly negotiate in advance with the union at the one facility mentioned is of no current
relevance at this time since the US. Government General Service Administration (GSA)
smoking policy has since been updated to allow total smoking bans at the discretion of the
US. Government Agency Heads. The US. Department of Health and Human Services has
established total smoking prohibitions at all of its facilities, including the IHS.136
In most facilities, IHS gave employees time off to attend smoking cessation programs and
offered nicotine gum to those who wanted it. The labor unions also made these available to
their members.
EVALUATION
Overall, II-IS feels reaction to the ban was positive. The majority of complaints came from
smoking staff members and these subsided after the first several months. Few patients
complained, and compliance to the prohibition has been good. In evaluating its policy, the
Indian Health Service emphasizes the following points;
Iin addition to strong top leadership, there must be significant early employee and staff
participation and involvement In some facilities, IHS could have done a better job of
involving the unions in developing and communicating the policy to employees.
The strong support of employees and the fact that the policy applied equally to all was the
key to the success of the policy.

CITY OF BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON
• Separately ventilated smoking room
BACKGROUND
Bellevue, with a population of 85,000, lies just across Lake Washington from Seattle. A
suburb in the 1960s, it has since become the fourth largest city in the state, boasting branches
of many national corporations and a burgeoning downtown skyline. Bellevue's 11
government departments are headquartered in City Hall. Other facilities include sewage
treatment plants, mechanical barns, maintenance sheds, parks, a community college, fire
stations, other buildings and vehicles. Five unions represent a third of the city's 900
employee workforce_
THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
By 1985 Bellevue already had developed a sirnple and successful smoking policy for city
vehicles: nonsmokers prevail. But that year, a group of nonsmoking employees in City
Hall complained about tobacco smoke at their desks. They took their grievance to the
Employee Committee, a standing committee of elected and appointed employee
representatives charged with handling personnel matters, and the Committee created a
Smoking Policy Committee, made up of smokers, nonsmokers and ex-smokers to explore
the issue.
The Committee knew that its policy would have to work in every city facility, and in
unionized departments with different working conditions. To smooth the process, they
invited representatives from the five unions to work with them. They researched the
health effects of EFS, discussed policy options, and outlined a strategy. The first step was an
employee survey to document smoking preferences and attitudes. The survey revealed that
only 19% of employees smoked, that over 70% felt tobacco smoke was a problem, and
suggested that the workforce would more strongly support designated smoking rooms than
a ban.
Concurrent with the survey, presentations were scheduled for all employees. The
presentation explained that the City was considering a policy, explained the reasons why,
covered the health effects of ETS, and solicited reactions from the employees. Smokers and
nonsmokers were able to air their concerns as well as ideas for solutions. The presentations
were instrumental in developing support for the policy because all sides felt their views
were heard.
Since employee opinion strongly favored designated smoking rooms, the City examined
that option with a ventilation engineer. Fortuitously, at that time, the City Hall lobby was
being renovated, and for under $5,000 the City of Bellevue created a smoking lounge with
separate ventilation in the City Hall. This would satisfy City Hall employees.

53

A smaller number of employees worked outside City Hall. These workers (police,
firefighters, sanitation workers, utilities workers, mechanics, etc.) had greater mobility than
those in City Hall, and agreed that separate smoking rooms were unnecessary: they could
easily smoke outside.
With that decision the policy was determined: smoking would be prohibited except in
designated smoking areas. In buildings with no designated area, smoking would be
restricted to outside.
IMPLEMENTATION
Three months before it was to begin, the City announced the policy with employee
newsletters and bulletins. They explained the role of employee input in shaping the policy
and invited comment. Concurrently, they offered free smoking cessation classes to all who
wanted them. Approximately a third of the smokers participated, and many of those quit
smoking Because the City Hall smoking lounge was not ready when the policy took effect,
the City temporarily designated a portion of the lunch room as a smoking area; a few
months later, the permanent lounge was opened.
Shortly after the policy was announced, the attorney for the Police Guild argued that it
represented an unfair change in working conditions. But Guild leadership, satisfied with
the policy, refused to make an issue of it.
EVALUATION
Overall, reaction to the policy was good. Some employees complained in the first few
months, but grievances gradually tapered off and stopped. City managers had been
concerned that unhappy smokers would defy the policy by smoking in secret, but only one
employee did so. Despite "no smoking" signs, visitors occasionally light up in the building,
but always stop smoking when asked. A second City concern, that smokers taking breaks in
the lounge would suffer a decline in productivity, did not materialize.
In evaluating its policy, the City of Bellevue emphasizes the following points:
The City of Bellevue's maximized employee participation in policy development.
The City established an adequately-ventilated, designated smoking room.

CHAPTER 12: Smoking Policies in Health Care Facilities
The reasons to establish smoking policies in health care facilities are clear: patients are
particularly susceptible to injury from EIS, and, surrounded by flammable materials,
patients smoking in bed are a safety risk to themselves and others (the American Hospital
Association has stated that 66% of all hospital fires are caused by smoking). Many health
care facilities have successfully implemented policies. However, some hesitate to do so
because of the following concerns:
Patients Who Smoke
Nicotine is addictive, just like heroin or cocaine. Patients who smoke may not be able to
stop, regardless of their health. Many hospitals have alleviated this problem by prescribing
nicotine gum to addicted patients during the hospital stay.
Nurses
While the smoking rate among physicians is significantly lower than that of the general
population, the rate among nurses is not. This means that many hospitals employ large
numbers of nurses who smoke. At a time when health care facilities face a nursing
shortage, many are reluctant to do anything that might alienate nurses or impair their
recruitment. However, hospitals that have implemented policies report that few nurses
leave because of the smoking policy. Including nurses in policy formulation is regarded by
many hospitals as a key factor in the overall success of the policy. When included in the
process nurses are often strong supporters of smoking policies.
Marketing
Hospitals today are increasingly competitive as they fight for market share, many like to
avoid policies that may potentially alienate customers. Smokers are among their best
customers, for while they are a minority of the population, they have higher rates of
hospitalization. Hospitals with policies, however, report no decline in admissions.
The following case studies explain how two health care facilities addressed the smoking
issue. The Lexington Clinic prohibited smoking in its facilities. Swedish Hospital also
prohibited smoking in its facilities.

THE LEXINGTON CLINIC
• Smoking Prohibition
BACKGROUND
The Lexington Clink is a 100-physician, multi-specialty group practice clinic. Its 11 buildings
are scattered throughout Lexington, Kentucky, where the Clinic has been operating for 70
years. It has no overnight facilities; patients requiring hospitalization are referred to local
hospitals. However, some patients stay at the Clinic for several hours for extended
procedures. The Clink is owned by its physicians, and operated by an elected physician
Board of Directors and an administrative staff. It has 650 employees, and is not unionized.
The Clinic is located in a region that many consider the burley capital of the world. Many of
Its patients are tobacco farmers and their families, and tobacco forms the backbone of the
local economy. Clinic staff was concerned that introducing a smoking policy would
potentially anger Clinic patients and supporters.
THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The idea of a smoking policy was first raised in 1982. Staff, concerned about the dangers of
ETS, urged management to restrict smoking. They felt that despite the community's
reliance on tobacco, the Clinic should set a health standard for its patients by eliminating
ETS. Management asked the Clinic's Safety Committee to study the issue.
The Safety Committee was a management committee whose members included both health
care and non-health care professionals. After weighing both sides of the ETS
issue—community concerns vs. the health of their patients—they recommended a policy
restricting smoking to designated lobby areas, private offices and employee lounges. They
felt that was consistent with what other organizations were doing about Eib, and that it
would not upset the community.
But as new information surfaced about the dangers of passive smoking, staff concerns
continued to grow. In late 1986, following publication of the Surgeon General's report,
Clinic administrators asked the Safety Committee to re-examine the smoking issue. Their
mandate was to research information on ETS and recommend a course of action.
The Safety Committee spent several months gathering information. They reviewed
medical literature on the health effects of ETS, examined ventilation options, and consulted
experts in the field. Finally, convinced that ETS had to be eliminated from the facilities and
that proper ventilation for smoking rooms would be prohibitively expensive, the
Committee recommended that smoking be banned inside Lexington Clinic facilities.

IMPLEMENTATION
Clinic administrator's announced the policy in March, 1987 and scheduled it to begin on July
4th. They also appointed an employee committee of smokers, nonsmokers and ex-smokers
to help plan its implementation, and a management committee to develop the programs
and strategies recommended by the -employee committee.
The committees' roles were to educate employees, physicians and patients about the policy,
and to act as conduits for employee feedback and concerns. Using material gathered by the
Safety Committee, they developed a memo explaining the health risks of ETS, the Clinic's
lack of ventilation options, and the rationale for the decision to prohibit smoking. It
stressed that the policy was a health initiative, not a moral crusade, and reminded people
that they were free to smoke outside during employee breaks. The Committee also arranged
for the Clinic to offer free smoking cessation, weight loss, and stress reduction classes to
employees and their spouses.
During this period, feelings about the ban were divided. One group of physicians and
employees, including both smokers and nonsmokers, supported it_ They felt that as a health
care facility, the Clinic had no choice but to ban a substance that could harm their patients.
On the other side were smokers and nonsmokers who felt the ban would insult their many
tobacco farming patients.
As July 4th crept closer, a small group of physicians and employees remained actively
opposed. To address their concerns a presentation was scheduled for the Clinic's 100
physicians.
At the meeting all sides were given a chance to voice their concerns- In addition, the
physicians were presented the most recent medical research, the current status of litigation
and legislation, public opinion surveys, trends in smoking policies in health care facilities
and other organizations, and the costs associated with permitting smoking. At the end of
the presentation, an influential physican stood up. "I am a smoker," he said, "and until
now I have been opposed to this ban. But in light of this information, I am changing my
mind. As owners of this organization, we have a responsibility, we cannot allow smoking
in our buildings." The group of physicians voted for the prohibition.
Two weeks later the policy went into effect. The Clinic built covered smoking shelters
outside to protect smokers from weather and to show smokers they were aware of their
needs. They kept cigarette vending machines in the buildings to remind smokers that they
were not forcing them to quit, merely restricting when and where they smoke.
EVALUATION
To everyone's surprise, the ban was widely accepted from the first. According to the policy,
employee enforcement is handled as it is for any Clinic policy: violators receive verbal
counseling, written counseling and finally dismissal if they fail to comply. However, these

penalties have never been necessary. The occasional infractions, which are generally from
patients and not staff, are curtailed with verbal reminders.
Community reaction was also positive. The local media gave the policy positive coverage.
Daily visits held constant at 1,400. And while the Clinic had braced for a strong reaction
from tobacco farmers, they received only two letters of complaint.
In evaluating its policy, the Lexington Clinic emphasizes the following points:
The Lexington Clinic's implementation of an aggressive communication and education
effort during the three-and-a-half month adjustment period.
The establishment of an outdoor, covered smoking area.
SWEDISH HOSPITAL, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
• Smoking Prohibition
BACKGROUND
Swedish Hospital, with 600 beds, is the largest hospital in the Northwest. It has a medical
staff of 1,000 and occupies a dozen buildings near downtown Seattle.
Tag POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The policy development and implementation process occured in three stages over two
years. It began in 1985 when the hospital's executive director, Dr. Alan Lobb, convened a
Smoking Policy Committee to study the smoking issue. Lobb felt strongly about the dangers
of smoking and asked the Committee, which included smoking and nonsmoking
managers, to determine how the hospital could limit ETS in its facilities.
While the Committee knew that Lobb's preference was to prohibit smoking, they felt that
introducing restrictions gradually would be a better way to proceed. As a first step, they
created a number of no smoking areas: most of the cafeteria was made "smoke-free," and
each department was asked to decide if it wanted smoking in its employee lounge.
Smoking was still permitted by patients in their rooms.
The decision to allow each department to establish its own policy proved difficult, however,
as department managers became caught between smokers and nonsmokers' competing
demands. Finally staff asked the Committee to create a hospital-wide policy. A year after
the fast policy was introduced, the Committee revised it to prohibit smoking by employees
and visitors everywhere in the building. Only patients were permitted to smoke in their
rooms.
58
PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT — DO NOT U I k. OR QUOTE
566405852

Before the new policy took effect, employees objected, requesting one place in the building
where smoking would be allowed. The hospital complied, and established a separately
ventilated smoking room in the cafeteria. When the concentration of smoke in the small
area proved too much for the ventilation system, new exhaust fans were added. Even with
the new fans, the air filters had to be changed twice a week and the room's walls discolored.
After six months the medical staff of the hospital, wanting to set an example in the
community, asked Dr. Lobb to recommend a complete prohibition. With the full support of
the CEO and the medical staff, the Committee then announced that Swedish would be a
smoke-free hospital. The only exception would be occasional patients who would be
permitted to smoke with their doctor's agreement.
IMPLEMENTATION
Before the policy was to go into effect, memos were sent to all employees informing them of
the ban and the reasons behind it. They also offered free cessation classes to all who wanted
them. A relatively small number signed up, and some employees quit smoking.
Knowing it was important to reach patients before they arrived, the hospital made strong
efforts in patient education_ They printed "tent cards" explaining the policy and distributed
them to all physicians who refer patients to Swedish, and added information about the
policy to their pre-admission packets.
EVALUATION
The policy met with little resistance. The hospital received complaints from patients who
argued that they had removed their only solace during sickness. The hospital answered
with an explanation of the health benefits of the policy.
Compliance with the policy has been good. Enforcement is done by physicians rather than
nurses. If a patient insists on smoking, his or her physician will decide whether or not the
smoking should be allowed. To smoke, the patient must be in a private room, and the
circumstances must be exceptional.
Concerns that smoking patients would take their business elsewhere have not been
realized. Swedish has seen no decline in admissions since going smoke-free.
In evaluating its policy, Swedish Hospital emphasizes the following points:
The support of the leadership of Swedish Hospital was the key to the successful
implementation of the new smoking policy.
The hospital made a strong commitment to educate patients about the policy before they are
admitted to the hospitaL

CHAPTER 13: Smoking Policies in Schools
Thirty-two states restrict or prohibit smoking by students)2-1 Nearly as many restrict
smoking by faculty to "adults only" areas. These areas are frequently under-ventilated,
however, and smoke seeps easily to areas where children are present. According to the
Surgeon General, "a total prohibition of smoking on school grounds provides the greatest
protection from sidestream smoke exposure and unwanted role modeling effects."124 Yet
many schools are hesitant to impose such a ban for the following reasons:
Fear of Angering Teachers
Teachers are under tremendous pressure. Administrators are reluctant to add to the
pressure with a potentially "unpopular' restriction. However, studies of other worksites
show that smoking bans are popular with the majority of employees, and that smokers
adjust to the ban within several months.
Enforcement
Like administrators in any worksite, school principals are not eager to create policies which
contain potential discipline problems.
This chapter profiles the Andover Unified School District #385, which prohibited smoking
for teachers as well as students. Its success led to smoke-free schools throughout the state of
Kansas.
ANDOVER, KANSAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS
• Smoking Prohibition
BAOCGROUND
With 3,600 people, Andover, Kansas might qualify as a small town—except that it is a
suburb of Wichita. In the 1970s, Andover's quiet life, ample space, and small school district
began attracting families from the city. By 1978 the district had grown to 1,200 students. It
had one high school which permitted smoking in the building for teachers but prohibited it
for students.
THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
By 1978, smoking in the high school had become a source of tension. Students were
slipping out to smoke between classes, and at lunchtime the lawn was filled with students
lighting up. Teachers were reprimanding students who took cigarettes out in school, and
parents were concerned about their children's health. To ease the problem, school board
members suggested prohibiting student smoking on school grounds as well as in the
60 PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
566405854

buildings. However, other school board members objected that prohibiting smoking for
students—while letting teachers smoke—was hypocritical and unfair. They advocated
prohibiting smoking in the Andover School District for teachers as well as the students. Na
school district they knew of had prohibited smoking for teachers, but as the school board
examined its options, it seemed like the best one.
Knowing that a prohibition might meet resistance in the community, the school board
gathered ammunition. First, they polled students and teachers to find out how many
smoked: the number was small. Next, they examined their insurance coverage and
discovered that prohibiting smoking on school grounds would drop their property
insurance premium significantly. This was a compelling argument for a fiscally
Conservative school board, and one they expected would be equally powerful for the
community, which was currently seeking funds for a new gymnasium. The board took this
Information to the next public school board meeting.
To their surprise, the prohibition idea met little resistance. Parents embraced it, thankful to
have help from the school in curbing their children's smoking. Most teachers cheered it,
because they favored further tobacco restrictions for students, because they hoped it would
reduce the tensions over smoking, or because they were eager to rid the school of ETS.
Only a small group of teachers protested, claiming the school board was abridging their right
to smoke, and overstepping its role as administrators.
The board discussed the issue at five public school board meetings before deciding to pass
the prohibition. Ultimately they felt the writing was on the wall. The strong feelings of the
community and the nation's growing intolerance for smoking suggested that if they didn't
prohibit smoking themselves, the state would eventually make them do it. One school
board member said, "if you wait until the state makes you do it, you've waited too long."
IMPLEMENTATION
The board announced the prohibition in August with a one-paragraph memo. It stated that
beginning the following September, smoking would be prohibited for students and teachers
in school buildings and on school grounds. Although some teachers had objected strongly
to the prohibition while it was under discussion, complaints died down once the policy was
on the books. Those who still wanted to smoke drove down the street. Most refrained
from smoking during school hours. In an unexpected side benefit, the district found that
without cigarettes, teachers spent less time in the faculty lounge and more time with
students in hallways, schoolyards, and lunchrooms.
Enforcing the prohibition among students has been easier than enforcing the earlier policy,
in part because it has eliminated the problem of students lighting up "on their way
outside." According to school representatives, discipline problems are "nothing compared
to what they were."

EVALUATION
In the community, the prohibition was widely supported. Parents were delighted to see the
school curb smoking. The large majority of teachers approved. Even people with no
connection to the schools supported the decision to protect the health of students. The local
newspaper published an editorial praising the school board for its decision.
In evaluating its policy, the Andover School District emphasizes the following points:
The Andover School District worked to gain extensive public support for its effort to
eliminate smoking from environments with children..
Thepolicy was fair because it placed the same rules on teachers and students.
AFTERMATH
Nine years after Andover implemented its smoking prohibition, the state of Kansas
prohibited smoking in public schools statewide. Several other school districts had followed
Andover's lead, and hoping to spread the policy to the rest of the state, the Governor asked
a state representative to introduce a bill in the legislature.
The debate in the legislature was partisan, divided by political party and smoking
persuasion. Proponents argued that the bill was necessary to protect the health of children;
opponents argued that smokers' rights were being taken away. However, the opponents
were outnumbered, and in 1987, Kansas became the first state to prohibit smoking in
schools for teachers as well as students. Public response was overwhelmingly positive.

iNTRoot CTION
The impact of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
on individuals has become an area of heightened
interest in recent years. To assess exposure of both
smokers and non-smokers to ETS. chemical constitu-
ents of smoke such as carbon Inoantude, nicotine sad
hydrogen cyanide have been proposed as beicheracal
markers. The limitations of each of these as bio•
markers have been examined (Benowita, 1983. Flaky
et a!, 1988; Poor et al. 1984). However, many
workers investigating the potential health effects of
exposure to ETS believe that nicotine and its inetab-
Olik, coinsure, are the best currently available bio-
=slums for ETS exposure (Cummings et al., 1990;
Haley et at., 1988; Jarvis, 1989, Wall et at., 1988). The
usefulness of nicotine as a biomarker for ETS is limi-
ted, owing to its short half-life (120 min, Benowitz.
1986). Counine has a much longer half-life (19 hr,
range 10.9 to 37 hr; Bencrwitz, 1983: Benowitz et at,
1983). Cotinme has been claimed to provide advan-
tages for determining expeaure to ETS, based on
Mien* suggested by Jarvis (1989). (I) it has been
thought to be tobacco specific: (2) it is a major
metabolite of nicotine, (3) its excretion is kss
infharnced by urinary pH than is that of tucotine, and
(4) it is easily measurable in plasma, urine or saliva
Recently, doubt has been C3St on the snidely
accepted belief that nicotine is unique to tobacco

(National Research Council. 1986). Plant sources
other than tobacco have beers reported to contain
varying levels of nicotine, many of such plants are
common dietary constituents, for example egg plant,
tomato and green pepper (Castro and Mot* 1986,
Sheen, 1980 These plants are primarily from the
family Solsaaceac. most members of which have been
reported to produce nicotine (Kuhn. 1964, Leek, 1983:
Pailer, 196d). %waver. nicotine has a wider distribu-
tion in the plant kmgdorn• it has been reported in
12 families and 24 genera (Leete. 1983). Its function
in these plants is unknown, however, it has been
suggested that it is a natural defence against bacteria,
fungi, insects and animals (Ames. 1983; Kuhn, 1964)
The purposes of this research were to confirm the
presence of nicotine in common foods and to assess
the we of coimme as a btomarker for ETS in the light
of the results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, Nicotine salicylate, N-ethylnOrmicotine
salicylate. cotinine perchlorate and N-ethylnostratinme
perchlorate were purchased (Institut f

and mass ipectreenetry (GC:MS). Methylene chloride,
methanol and 2-propanol were purchased (Baxter
Healthcare Corporation, Scientific Products Division,
MeGaw Park, IL, USA). Solvent paints and
absence of nicotine contamination were I:Gahm:led by
CiC-NPD. Sodium hydroxide (5.0 it) was purchased in
sealed 1-litre bottles (Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh,

system comprising aninmc and cationic
resin beds and an activated carbon filter (Millipore

limits of detection and quantitation were determined

Nicotine peak identity was confirmed by GC'NIS
using two independent systems. Fast, samples pre-
pared by the method of Davis (1986) were injected
into a VG Tno-1 GC:MS system (VG Instruments.
Danvers, MA, USA) Sepal alien of sample analres
was accomplished using capallary columns with
'Meting selectivities (1)6-5 or DDWAX) or two inde-
pendent analytical determinations. The eluant from

Secondly, selected samples were introduced by multi-
dimensional gas chromatography (White and Johnson,
1990; White eta! • 1990) to a Hewlett-Packard Model
5988A mass spectrometer In this system, two ions
specific for nicotine, m!: 84 and en:' 162. were
monitored in the electron impact mode at 70 eV with
an electron multiplier voltage of 2000 V.
Sample preparretion Produce and tea samples were
purchased from local grocery stores, in addition to
some tomatoes that were obtamed fresh from local
gardens. Vegetables were washed thoroughly with
water, diced and puréed in a blender. Portions of the
purees 42 gi were placed in 50-ml polypropylene
centrifuge tubes (Corning Glass Works. Corning.
NY, USA) with 6 ml 005 N-HC1. These 11111CLUFCS
were homogenized for 30 40 sec with a Polytron
(Brinkman Instruments, Westbury. NY. USA) at a
setting of 6.
Tea samples were weighed. placed mrectly into the
disposable centrifuge tubes with the 0 05 N-HC1. and
homogenized Samples were centrifuged at 2500-
3000 rpm (Sorvall. Model RT 6000, E. L DuPont
Company. Clinical Instruments Div., Wilmington,
DF. USA) Three 1-ml ahquots of the supernatants
were mated (Pipet man. Rainin Instrument Com-
pany, Inc. Woburn. MA, USA) into clean Pyrex
glass culture tubes (16 e 100MM) with teflon-lined
screw caps (Kimble Science Products. Vineland. NI,
USA) and extracted as described (Davis, 1986).
Tea samples were also prepared in cold water and
the resulting solutions extracted and analysed for
nicotine. Weighed portions (approx 2 g) of tea leaves
or of instant teas were placed in 50-ml disposable
polypropylene centrifuge tubes and 10 ml cold,
&ionized-distilled water was added. The samples
were mixed (Burrell Wrist Action Shaker, Model 75,
Burrell Corporation. Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for
30 min at ambient (=permute (25 C). Phases were
separated by centrifuganOn at 3000 rpm for 20 nun.
Two aliquots (1 0 ml each) of each tea preparation
were mutated for nicotine content
Additionally, following package directions, appro.
pnate amounts 41 or 2 laispoons) of instant teas or
one tea bag were placed into cups containing 240 (al
boiling water. The teas were steeped for up to 5 nun
and then stirred. 1 wo aliquots (1 0 ml each) of each
tea preparation were examined for nicotine content
Nicotine intake values were estimated from average
and maximal consumption of foods (see Table 4)
We further estimated the resultant urinary cotinine
concentrations, assuming that nicotine metabolism
would be the same no matter how much food was con-
sumed. Other assumptions underlying our estimates
of urinary connine concentrations are as follows:
(I) only 25% of the nicotine in food is bioavadabk
(based upon oral intake of nicotine in tobacco):
(2) only 25°A of nicotine is excreted as comma
(Svensson. 1987). (31 the individual weighs 70 kg and
is at steady-state counine conditions, And (4) the daily
urine volume is l litre
Data analy.srs Calibration curves for nicotine and
combine were developed by linear regeeision of the
peak area ratio (analyteinnernal standard) r known
standard concentrations Standards and samples were
injected in dOplieme and the results averaged Peak
areas were integrated by both the Hewlen-Packard
Level Four Integrator/Plotter and by PeakPro data
acquisition software (Beckman:Computer Inquiry
Systems. Inc Waldwick, NJ. USA) The quanutation
of nicotine and cotinine by these systems was identical
within experimental error Statistical analyses applied
to the data included determinations of the coefficient
of correlation and coetfictent of determinalson, un-
paired Student's I-tests (RStl. Release 4, BBN Soft-
ware Products Corporation, Cambridge, MA. USA),
and a r-test for correlated ohservations (Bruning and
K intz, 19R7t.

agent blanks were taken than*. 6 procedure ideritical
to that undergone by the plant maunials. Any osmium
observed to these reagent blanks was subtracted from
the sample value_ The average nicotine concentration
of reagent blanks (1 3 ng;m1) was near the detection
limit for the method
Our results confirm that certain vegetables, black
tea and instant tea contain nicotine (Tables I and 2)
The nicotine concentration for market tomatoes
(5.1 ngig wet weight) was about one-half of the
nicotine Concentration in fresh kindly grown tomatoes
(9.6 erg wet wagba The concentration of nicotine
in the flesh of the potato (I5 ngfg wet weight) was
approximately three-fold greater than the concentra-
tion in the peel. Nicotine was also detected in cauli-
flower, a non-solanoceous vegetable. No nicotine was
observed above background in green pepper and egg
plant—two solanaccous vegetables previou,,ly reported
to contain nicotine (Castro and Morui. 1986, Sheen,
1988)
Nicotine was found in black tea leaves and instant
tea powders (Tab(e 2). corroborating previous find-
ings by Sheen (1988). Aqueous extracts of the teas
produced at 25 sed tOO'C were also found to contain
nicotine. Greater amounts of nicotine were extracted
from the tea leaves by hot water than by water at
room temperature (P < 0.0.5). Less nicotine was found
in the decaffeinated tea brands than in regular tea
brands, independent of the temperature of the water
used to prepare thc tea. These results suggest that
the process of decaffeination eliminates sonic of the
nicotine. The highest concentrations of niCOttne in
any of the samples were observed in instant tea.
No counine was detected in any of the vegetables
or teas.
DISCUSSION
The source of the nicotine found in these plant
products poses an interesting question Either the
plants possess the Mosy-nthetic pathway for the
pnoduction or nicotine, or it results from some con-
tamination. perhaps insecucide residue. as postulated
by Sheen (1988) thosynthesized nitioutle occurs in a
number of botanical species, but is maw only associ-
ated with Nicottana (Kuhn. 1964: Leete. 1983) and
other Soianaceae (Table 31 Nicotine results from
the combination of two independently synthesized
moieties, a pyndyl ring derived from nicotinic acid
and an N•frietityl pyrroliihne ring formed by an
N-methyl-pyrollinium salt derived from N-methyl
putrescme. The biosynthetic pathways for nicotine by
plant species other than members of the Sulanamae
have not been well charactenaed. However, similar
routes for synthesis of the N-methylpyrrolidine nag
and incorporation of this moiety into other molecules
have been demonstrated in plants unrelated to
Nicotiana (Leete, 1963).

the application of quality assurance samples, and the
confirmatory analyses offered by two independent
mass spectrometric methods suppori our conclusion
that nicotine was present in the plant samples
Although the possibility of contamination of the
samplft by environmental nicotine during sample
prevention cannot be eliminated entirely, it is
unlikely to have occurred because measures suggested
by Feecrabend and Russell (19110), such as clean
glassware and protection of nampks from airborne
nicotine. were used to lessen its impact Proof that
nicotine contamination was kept to a minimum is
given by the extremely low nicotine content of blank
samples (1.3 ngiml) Caffeine was found in all of the
tea extracts, but did not interfere with nicotine
determination as has been reported for HPLC
determination of cotinine (Thuan et at 19891.
Direct comparison of our results with the two
previous studies that reported the pretence of nicotine
in foods is diffcuk Diffetences in sample preparation,
analytical methods and etpression of the data may
contribute to this difficulty. For example, Sheen
(191111) reports the data in parrs per million of the dry
weight, whereas both Castro and Monji (1986) and
this study report data in units of ng,:g wet weight. To
facilitate comparisons with Sheen (1988), we report
our data on a dry weight basis also, as described
below Tame 1
Discrepancies in the reported nicotine contents of
foods became apparent when data were compared in
similar units of measurement The large amounts of
nicotine reported by Sheen (19881 may neat from
concentration during lyoptulization, contamination of
the samples. or both Howeser the intormation given
in Sheen.1 paper provides no basis for invalidation of
the data Castro and Monji (1910 wed radsommuno-
assay to determine nicotine in shirrici sonipaes of fresh
and processed foods. Although the end determinauon
of rld4:4AUTe differs, our data are more Linn/fir to those
of Castro and Monji (1916) for foods common to
both studies Gas chromatography and radmimmuno-
assay determinations yield similar analytical data for
nicotine and cotinine (Biber et al , 1987: Bjercke et al.,
1986). There is no doubt that small amounts of
nicotine are present in dietary products.
Cotinine has been used as a biomarker for
exposure to nicotine because it is one of the major
metabolites of nicotine, it is eliminated by the kidney
with bine influence of urinary lion and pH (tinlilce
nicotine), it is easy to measure in biological &ids.. and
it has been preowned to be superior to thiocyanate and
cartionybaemoglohin levels on the basis of specificity.
In addition, the pharmacokmetics of cotinine are well
understood (Benowitz et at.. 1983, Curvall el al.,
1990, DeSchepper er at., 1987).
Cot Mine concentrations in biological fluids may
be useful for classifying persons as active unitkers
or non-smokers Jarvis et al (1987) examined the
specificity and sensitivity of 11 test parameters in
exhaled breath, plasma, salina and urine from self-
reported smokers and non-smokers. Subsequently
21 of the non-smoker subjects were re-classified as
smokers on the basis of the test parameters Both
sensitivity and specificity improved as a result of the
re-classification Cotinine was shown to be superior
to the other biomarker compounds used by these
investigators. However, even at the improved level
of sensitivity (96-97%), seven active (by self-report)
smokers were classified as non-smokers. Misclassi-
fication of these seven subjects was attributed to
potential lack of deep inhalation or thc absence of
smoking on the day of the survey. These difficulties
obtained even though the subject population was well
defined
Idle (1990) was critical of the classification scheme
used by Jarvis et al, (1987) on the grounds that
dietary nicotine intake, some anomaly in metabolism
of nicotine or cotinine, or an analytical deficiency
could have led to incorrect classification. These factors
assume greater importance when the subject popula-
tion is not well characterized and nicotine intake is
slight, as in ETS exposure.
Classibmtion becomes more difficult when people
must be segregateCI on the basis of ETS exposure
regardless of the Inomarker chosen. In another study
(Wallet a!, 19811). confine was measured in plasma,
saliva and urine from groups of non-ETS-exposed
non-smokers, ETS-exposed non-smokers, and active
smokers Clear segregation of the active smokers from
the other subject groups was possible on thc Wit
of cotinine concentrations in all three mattiees:
however, separation of ETS-exposed in-smokers
and non-exposed non-smokers by wirier) cotinine
measurements w difficult. Normalization of the
data on the basis of creatinine excretion provided
only slight impeovement, owing to inter-subject vari-
ation. These authors conciuded that concentrations
of cotinine in saliva and scrum do not allow discrimin-
ation between ETS-exposed non-smokers and non-
exposed non-smokers, because of the following

factors. (1) vanance in nicotine metabolism, (2) time-
of-day influence on sample collection; (3) under-
reporting of active smoking, by persons who actively
smoke one or more cigarettes per day and claim to
be 'nnn-smokers'; (4) adjustment of cigarette con-
sumption fot nicotine content, and (5) over- and
under-reporting of exposuie to cigarette smoke.
Castro and Morgi 09861 fIrn suggested that dietary
intake of nicotine could Otinfound the reaults of studies
dealing with human disease Them aUthi3M Statt that
the amount of nicotine iiigested from dietary mums
closely parallels or may tleeed that ingested directly
or indirectly from the smoke of nationally advertised
"low-yield" cigarettes'. In a critical review, Idle
(1990) addressed thc relationship of cotinine measure-
ments and tobacco smoke exposure and challenged
the mcfulness or epiderniolopail studies that relied
soligy on cotinine values to support ETS exposure.
He calculated that as much nicoune could be obtained
from food sources as from niCOtitte received from 1-2
cigarettes per day, based on Sheen's data (Sheen,
1988).
If only average quantitici of foods listed in Table 4
are consumed, then the daily intake of nicotine would
be 8 8 pg. The resulting urinary cotinine concentration
is estimated to be 0.6 Maximal food and tea
consumption results in an approximately ten-fold
increase in nicotine intake (1000g/day) and ziO esti-
rusted unitary counim concentration of 6.2 ROIL
Ibis range of estimated urinary axinine coacientra-
lions (0 6 to 6.2 ng/m1) is very Sinufar to that obaerved
in non-smokers who claim no exposure to FT& aed
in ETS-exposed non-smokers (Cummings et at. 1990;
deBethixy et al., 1989; Wall et at., 1988).
Diet is not usually controlled in most studies of
ETS Most investigators assume that many of the
tmoontrollcd variables will 'average out in daily-life
exposure studies

INTRODUCITON
NICOTINE has long been recognized as 1 species specific and
Oleic metabolite of Nicoturria ;gaols and as the principle of
babit-forotiog 0:impanel& for tobacco users. Its implication in
Cardiervascula r diseases and the potential carcinogenicity in lieu
of the in vivo formation of nitrosamines (Nair et al., 1986)
enhaiMeS its took imago in the public mind. In the wake of
tolls= and heakb s, the income of tobacco farmers
has =eddy in recent years. This kd to the stedy of
alternate met of tobacco as a source of dietary proiciu (Eishoff
et al.. 1978; Shorn and Sheen, 1985) and animal feed (Sheen,
1983). TObaCCO leaf mom has been isolated as crystals in
large quanta", and exhibited exceptionally high protein effi-
ciency ratio and excellent functional properties Ni,.utine con-
tamination in the protein was less than 20 ppb. This brings
1600 a cgaStiOn a whether this low level Of nicotine can also
be present in our food as an environmental pollutant and/or an
intrinsic metabolite in plants.
The detection of nicotine in plant materials other than to-
bocaaaras recorded in decayed potato as early as 1852 (Bosky
and Mdadoo. 1976). More recently, the book "Biteiyoultasis
der Alkatoide" ftifothes and Schulte. 1969) mentioned its oc-
CUrfetYX in various plant species but mUS1 ire/pita* in the
Soranocam. A low concentration of nicotine in tomato was
cited but dOtli WWII Nor given. In addition to potato and tellablo,
there are aim Selma:um planes masurned s Ycgetables in
our diet. Whether they arc all capable of iyadiesieing Mr:cam
and haw much is in the fresh produce and pro:teemed Ion& arc
questions important to food safety. The advancement of aux
lytical techniques such as gas-liquid chromotography (GLC),
coupled with alkali flame detector, has extended the detection
Emit of nicotine to a ng level. The purpose of the present study
was to Survey a number of So/onaceoe plants and the derived

INTRODUCTION
Numerous statements have been made in the scientific literature on
the biological activity of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (Depart-
ment of Health arid Human Services, 1986; National Research Council,
1986). Recent work with animals exposed 6 hr/day for 14 consecutive
days to aged and diluted sidestream smoke (AL)SS) reported minimal
histopathological changes in such studies, even when smoke concentra-
tions many times higher than those reported in the field were used (Cog-
et al., 1992) ADSS has been shown to be a suitable surrogate for ITS
(Baker and Proctor, 1990; Goo and Mantel, 1991; Guerin et al., 1992).
The purpose of the present study was to determine for histopathol-
ogy (1) if the changes seen in the above study of 14 days duration were
modified in subchronic (90-day) exposures, (2) whether any new changes
were obseived in subchronic exposures, (3) whether the dose-response
relationship was different after the subchronic exposure (using the same
target ADSS concentrations as used previously), and (4) whether the 90-
day changes (it any were noted) were reversible in a further 90-day pe-
riod without any exposure.
Target ADSS concentrations were 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/m3, the same as
those used in the 14-day study. Respectively, these correspond to "typi-
cal7 "extreme," arid "exaggerated" field measurements (Guerin et al,
1992).
The primary end point of this study was the histopathology of tile
respiratory tract and related organs. as assessed by pathologists with
experience in rodent inhalation studies with cigarette smoke. Secondary
end points included those suggested by regulaiory authorities (Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-Operation, 19811; other end points (CO-oximetry,
plasma nicotine and cotinine) were added to the basic protocol to verily
that smoke inhalation did occur (dosimetry).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design
The experimental design was based on published guidelines (Organi-
sation for Economic Co-Operation, 1981), Three groups of animals were
exposed to ALMS; there was a sham-exposed group exposed only to
filtered air. Animals were exposed to smoke inside whole-body chambers
(Chen et al., 1989) using nose-only restraint tubes. A further group of
animals was kept as sentinels for the detection of disease. There were
106 male animals in each of the four groups. Animals were exposed 6
hrfday, with animals killed after 4, 28, or 90 days of exposure. The 4-day
exposures were performed with only 10 animals per chamber; the cham-
bers were refilled with the remaining 96 animals per group for the 28-
566405877

9U-DAY SIDESTREAM SMOKE INHALATION STUDY 79
and 90-day exposures. Animals in satellite groups were kept tor a further
90 days without treatment to assess reversibility
Experimental Animals
A total of 506 male animals, weighing 125-150 g, was purchased from
Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Animals were housed individu-
ally in transparent polycarbonate cages and acclimated to laboratory con-
ditions for 14 days prior to the first exposure.
The Sprague- Dawleyrat (Crl:CD/BR, VAF/Plus) was chosen as the ex-
perimental animal because it has frequently been used in inhalation
studies and there is a large amount of background inhalation informa-
tion available in the scientific literature. Males only were used, to allow
sufficiently large group sizes for the many different end points studied.
Earlier work (Coggins et al., 1992) showed no difference between the
responses shown by males and females.
Within 5 days of delivery, five animals were randomly chosen and
killed for collection of sera, which were tested for the following antibod-
ies to disease: reovirus type 3, cilia associated respiratory bacillus,
Kilham's rat virus, Toolan's H-1 virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Sendai,
rat coronavirus/siaiodacryoadenitis virus, lymphocytie choriomeningitis
virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Antibody testing was made on sera
obtained from five animals at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the
inhalation part of the experiment, and at reversibility (total of 25 animals).
The lungs from the sentinel animals were taken and examined !lista-
pathologically to ascertain health status.
Within a week of delivery, the animals were allocated into four
groups of 106 animals each, such that the body weights in the groups
were as homogeneous a,. possible. The mean (± SD, n — 106) weights in
the sham, low, mid, and high groups at randomization were 157.7 ± 6.6,
157.5 ± 6.7, 157.6 ± 6.3, and 157.7 ± 6.6 g, respectively.
During the week after allocation into groups, animals were tail-
tattooed (Animal Identification and Marking Systems, Piscataway, NJ)
with their permanent identification number.
the animals were housed and cared for in accordance with the Ani-
mal Welfare Act of 1970 and amendments (Public Law 91-579), as set forth
in CFR 'title 9, Part 3 Sub-part E, Specification.s for the humane handling,
care, treatment, and transportation of warm-blooded animals other than
dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs and non-human primates. Ref-
erence was also made to the DHHS document Guide for the Care and
Use of laboratory Animals (N11-1 publication 86-23). Animals were housed
in a vivarium that had controlled lighting (12 hr of darkness, from 18:00
hr), temperature (20-24°C), and humidity (40-60% RH). Seven-day contin-
uous recordings were kept of RH d.nd temperature. Empty animal rooms
5664058'78

were certified (Certek, Raleigh, NC) as being class 100 (less than '100
particles/mi.
Animals had unrestricted access to certified teed (Purina Rodent
Chow no. 5002, presented as pellets) and distilled water. No feed was
available during inhalation exposures. Feed was withheld overnight prior
to necropsy. Chemical analyses ot feed, water, or bedding were noi per-
formed because it was deemed unlikely that contaminants would ad-
versely affect the experiment.
Cigarettes
The 1R4F reference cigarettes were purchased from the Tobacco and
Health Research Institute (Lexington, KY). A full description of the main-
stream, sidestream, and ETS chemistry of the 1R4F cigarette has been
published elsewhere (R. J. Reynolds, 1988), as has a description of the
physical and chemical characteristics of mainstream and environmental
tobacco smoke (Gon and Mantel, 1991). A description of the origins of
FTS has also been published (Baker and Proctor, 1990).
Aerosol Generation Apparatus
Methods have been described in detail elsewhere (Coggins et al.,
1992), the following constitutes a basic description only. A 30-port smoke
generator (CH Technologies, Westwood. NI), similar to that described by
Baumgartner and Coggins (1980) and by Ayres et al. (1990), was fitted with
an aluminum cone for collection of sidestrearn smoke (SS). Mainstream
smoke was generated under Federal Trade Commission conditions (ex-
cept butt length: 7 puffs were taken instead of burning to a fixed butt
length) and was discarded. Sidestream smoke was drawn from the cone
into a common plenum used for aging and diluting the smoke, using 3-
in. (76.2-mm)-diameter polyvinylchloricle (PVC) tithing throughout. Differ-
ent amounts of SS were drawn from the plenum for each chamber and
mixed with turther amounts of dilution air drawn from the room through
HEPA filters. Room air was HEPA-filtered "upstream." The sham and senti-
nel animals were kept in chambers that were not attached to the
plenum.
Animal Exposure Apparatus
The whole-body inhalation chamber (Moss et al., 1982) is available
commercially (Lab Products, Maywood, NJ). Each chamber was operated
at a flow rate of 16 f11/min (in excess of 15 air changes/hr).
The conical nose-only restraint tubes (Bauntganner and Coggins,
1980) are also commercially available (CH Technologies. Westwood, NJ);
they were used to minimize contamination of the pelt with deposited
ADSS which could then be absorbed dermally or ingested during preen-

ing (Langard and Nordhagen, 1980). Tubes were 73 mm in diameter and
263 mm long; the inlet was 22 mm in diameter. I he ventilation slots on
the restraint tubes were covered with duct tape.
On exposure days, individual animals were taken from their cage in
the chamber, placed inside a nose-only restraint tube, and replaced in
the tube into the same cage. The positions of racks within the chambers
were changed daily in order to minimize any effects of cage position
within the chamber.
Daily Characterization of Inhalation Exposures
During animal exposures. probes were used to monitor the aerosol
presented. this monitoring was by collection of aerosol on 25-mm Teflon
pads (TF-450, Gelman, Ann Arbor, Mb, followed by gravimetric determi-
nation of collected particulates using Cahn C-31 microbalances (Cahn,
Cerritos, CA). The RAM-1 instrument (MIF Corp., Redford, MA) was used
to give an on-line estimate of particulate mass concentrations.
The main analytical instrument used for estimating CO and CO; con-
centrations was the Horiba PIR-2000 (Horiba Instruments, Irvine, CA),
calibrated daily with certified gas mixtures (AIRCO Welding Supply,
Greensboro, NC). Oxygen ( oncentrations (%) were monitored by a
Horiba PMA-200 instrument, also calibrated with a certified gas mixture.
Very low concentrations of CO were measured with the Miran 80 gas
analyzer Woxhoro Instruments, South Norwalk, CT). Data from the on-
line instruments were logged manually every 60 min.
Measurement of nicotine and its pyrolysis product 3-ethenylpyridine
(Guerin et al., 1992) was by gas ( hromatography with thermionic-specific
detection. Chamber atmospheres were sampled with XAD-4 sorbent
tubes (SKC Inc., Eighty-Four. PA) that were extracted for analysis with
ethyl acetate containing 0.01% triethylamine (Ogden, 1989).
Solanesol measurements were made by liquid chromatography with
UV detection at 205 nm. After gravimetric determination of particulate
mass, the pads were extracted with 3 ml methanol for solanesol analyses
(Ogden and Maiolo, 1992).
Measurements of particle size distribution were made with Mercer-
style cascade impactors (Mercer et al., 1970; In-lox Products, Albuquer-
que, NM). The impactor had cutoff diameters in the range of 0.4-2.5 pm
under the conditions of use (L2 1/mm); calculation of mass median diam-
eter and associated standard geometric deviation was by probit analysis.
the cover slips (uncoated) used to collect the aerosol for impactor analy-
sis were weighed using Calm C-31 microbalances.
Temperature and % RH of the exposure atmosphere were measured
with a condensation dew point hygrometer (model 1100 DP, General East-
ern Instrument Co., Watertown, MA).

Clinical Observations
Animals were inspected visually for signs of overt toxicity as they
were being transferred from their cages to the restraint tubes and when
being transferred hack to their cages. More detailed clinical observations
were made on each animal once every 4 days, before the exposure and
within 2 hr of the end ot the exposure.
Body Weights
Individual body weights were determined within 48 hr of receipt, at
randomization, and every week thereafter, using Mettler PM 2000 bal-
ances.
Dosimetry
Blood samples were obtained after 6 hr of smoke exposure, on differ-
ent exposure days throughout the experiment. Blood was drawn from
the retro-orbital sinus, using anesthesia with 70% CO, in air and heparin-
ized micropipettes, and held on ice in plastic cuvettes containing diso-
dium edetate (Nai-FDTA) during the time between sampling and analysis.
Blood carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentrations were determined
on 0.5 ml of the total sample, using a model 482 CO-oximeter (Instru-
mentation Laboratories, Hartford, CT). Subsamples of the blood col-
lected for COHb were taken for the determination of plasma nicotine
and cotinine. The latter analyses were performed by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (Chang et al., 1992).
Necropsy
The following numbers of animals were allocated to necropsy and
subsequent histopathology in each of the four exposure groups: 10 for
the 4-day necropsy, 10 for the 28-day necropsy, 25 for the 90-day ne-
cropsy, and 15 for the reversibility necropsy. Remaining animals were
used for end points other than histopathology ino data presented here).
Animals were killed on the day following their last exposure, and the
time interval recorded. reed was not available to the animals during this
interval.
At necropsy, animals were weighed and then killed first by anestheti-
zation with 70% CO, in air and then exsanguination via the vena cava
prior to cessation of heartbeat. Blood samples for the various assays to
be performed were collected from the vena cava.
Animals were subjected to a complete gross examination in the pres-
ence of a board-certified veterinary pathologist, with special attention
paid to the respiratory tratt.

90-DAY SIDESIREAM SMOKE INHALAT40 \I STUDY 83
Clinical Pathology
The following assays were performed on whole blood obtained at
each necropsy: red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean red
cell volume, mean red cell hemoglobin, mean red cell hemoglobin con-
centration, white cell count, differential white cell count, reticulocyle
count, and platelet count. The anticoagulant Na,-FDTA was used; stan-
dard hematological methods were used.
The following assays were performed on serum obtained from ani-
mals at each necropsy: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potas-
sium, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,
glutamyl transpeptidase, inea nitrogen, albumin, creatinine, total
bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and total protein. The time of
blood sampling was recorded. Sure-Sep II serum separators (Organon-
Teknika, Durham, NC) were used to minimize hemolysis; the time be-
tween blood collection and serum collection was kept as short as possi-
ble Standard analytical methods were used.
Organ Weights
The lungs (complete with irachea but excluding the larynx), brain,
liver, testes (pair), kidneys (pair), and heart (excluding major vessels) were
weighed at each necropsy using Mettler PM 460 balances. Organ weights
and the (fasted) body weight recorded immediately before death were
used to calculate organ/body weight ratios. The time from removal of the
organ until weighing was minimized and tissues were kept in saline until
they were weighed.
Tissue Collection
Tissues were removed from each animal and fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin (NBA, at a volume dilution of 1 part tissue to at least 15
parts forrnalin (Feldman and Seely, 1988). The fixative contained 20 ml of
1% eosin per 20 I of 37% formalin as a precaution to identify the fluid as
fixative. Lungs were infused with NRF at a volume that ensured proper
distention and fixation. The trachea was ligated after distention.
The following tissues were collected: adrenals, aorta, bone (sternum,
femur), brain, cecum, colon, cranium, duodenum, epididymides, esoph-
agus, eyes/optic nerve, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidneys, larynx, liver,
lungs, lymph nodes (various), nasopharynx, nose/turhinates, pancreas,
parathyroid, pituitary, prostate, rectum, salivary gland, seminal vesicle,
skeletal muscle (thigh), skin (abdominal), spinal cord (lumbar), spleen,
stomach, tail, testes, thymus, thyroid, tongue, trachea, urinary bladder,
and Zymbal's gland.

Histopathology
Respiratory tract tissues (nasal passages, larynx, trachea, conducting
airways, deep lung), heart arid related lymph nodes (thymic and pen-
bronchial), and gross changes were examined in each of the animals
allocated to histopathology.
The nasal tissues were cut at three different locations to obtain repre-
sentative sections of the different epithelia, as described previously
(Young, 1981). The lungs were sectioned so as to provide a section along
the main stem bronchus of each lung lobe. A precise anatomic site for
cutting the larynges is required: serial step sections were taken to reach
this site (Burger et al., 1989; Sagartz et al., 1992).
Tissues were stained with hernatoxylin and eosin (H&E); duplicate
slides of a representative section of the anterior nasal tissues, larynx,
lung, and trachea were stained with periodic acid-Schiff/Alcian blue (PAS-
AB) to facilitate evaluations of mucus-secreting cells. Tissues were read
by an ACVP board-certified veterinary pathologist with knowledge of the
exposure groups.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical evaluations were made using Bartlett's test of homogeneity
ot variance, followed by analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) techniques. The
statistical evaluation of incidence and severity data for histopathology
was made by the Kohnogorov Smirnov test (Siegel, (956). Statistical tests
were carried out to 5%, two-sided criteria.
RESULTS
Inhalation Exposures
The mean concentrations ( ± SD, n 69) of wet total particulate mat-
ter (VVIPM) for the low-, medium-, and high-exposure groups were
0.105 ± 0.013, 1.01 ± 0.071, and 10.3 ± 0.691 mg/m% respectively. Figure
1 shows the within- and between-day variation in WTPM concentrations.
These WTPM exposures resulted in CO concentrations (ppm) of 2.9 ±
0.59, 9.3 ± 1.87, and 55.1 7.1-_ 5.0.
Nicotine concentrations (± SD, a— 14) at the medium and high ex-
posures were 272 ± 65 and 2377 ± 393 1.1011. Although nicotine could
be detected in the low-exposure chambers, the values were unexpect-
edly low: the mean was 0.39 ± 0.19 ftgirri'. The values for 3-
ethenylpyridine at the low, medium, and high exposures were 0.26 ±
0.39, 39.0 ± 8.7, and 320 ± 40 gfm. Solanesol concentrations ( ± SD,
n 14) in the low, medium, and high exposures were 1.9 ± 0.36, 22.9 ±
4.4, and 192 ± 18 ugim', respectively.
None of the above analytes could be detected at significant concen-

trations in the sham chamber Of in the exposure room. In the exposure
room, the mean CO2 concentration (± SD, n — 15) was 401 ± 50 ppm; in
the sham chamber the mean (± SD, n — 14) concentration was 1569 ±
286 ppm. The mean concentrations (± SD, n — 14) in the low, medium,
and high chambers were 1430 ± 140, 1702 ± 382, and 1745 ± 257 ppm,
respectively.
Particle size distributions at the low, medium, and high exposures
were similar, with the average values (± SD, n — 14) being 032 ± 0.08,
0.43 ± 0.06, and 0.53 ± 0.03 Am, respectively. The standard geometric
deviations were 1.94 ± 0_55, 1.59 ± 0.17, and 1.51 ± 0.11.
In-Life Observations
There were no exposure-related clinical signs or mortalities and the
serology results were negative. Animals in the smoke-exposed groups

showed body weights that were not different from those in the sham
group (Fig. 2); at no point did animals lose weight (Fig. 3).
Blood COHb concentrations at the end of the exposures were negli-
gible in the sham and low-exposure groups. The means for the medium
and high groups (± SD, n — 30) were 0.4 ± 0.4 and 4.9 ± 0.9%, respec-
tively.
The sham and low-exposure groups had plasma nicotine and
cotinine concentrations at or below the limit of detection. The mean
plasma nicotine for the mid- and high-exposure groups (± SD, n — 30)
were 20.5 ± 5.1 and 62.8 ± 9.8 ng/ml, respectively. The mean cotinine
concentrations (± SD, n — 29) were 26.6 ± 23 and 165 ± 41 ng/mi,
respectively.
Necropsy Data

Histopathology
In the nasal I section (transverse, immediately caudal to the incisor
teeth, Fig. 4), there was minimal to mild epithelial hyperplasia, in the
high-exposure group only. In this change, there was hypercellulanty and
thickening of the respiratory epithelium of the dorsal nasal conchae (na-
soturbinates: Figs. 5 and 6) and the adjacent wall of the middle meatus.
Figures 7 9 show the distributions of the different severities of this
change at the 4-, 28-, and 90-day necropsies, respectively. At each of these
necropsies the distribution of the change in the high-exposure group
was significantly different from that in the other groups; no such effect
was noted at the low or medium exposures.
There were no other histopathological changes noted in animals
killed at any of the necropsies, nor were any changes noted in the ani-
mals killed at the reversibility necropsy (i.e., the minimal changes noted
at the end ot the exposure were totally reversible).
The above results were made by a pathologist (JWS) with knowledge
of the exposure group. The slides and scores from these readings were
reviewed by a second pathologist (Dr. D. L. Dungworth) without knowl-
edge ot the exposure.
Because of the very similar incidences and severities seen in the high-
exposuie groups at the 4-, 28-, and 90-day necropsies, and because these
latter results were also similar to those noted in the earlier 14-day study
(Coggins et al., 1992), "blind" rereads on a combined set of slides tor the
high-exposure group only were performed. In the blind rereads, the pa-
thologists (operating independently) thus had knowledge of the expo-
sure group, but not of the duration of the exposure. Only the male ani-
mals were used from the 14-day study, mixed with the 4-, 28-, and 90-day
slides 01 the present study. The unmixed data from one of the patholo-
gists (JINS) are presented as Fig. 10: there were similar responses at each
of the time points, indicating no progression of the hyperplasia with
continued exposure.
DISCUSSION
The inhalation data presented here show that the target concentra-
tions were met and that the aerosols presented to the animals were res-
pirable by them. As in the earlier work (Coggins et al., 1992), we have no
explanation for the low concentrations of both nicotine and 3-
ethenylpyndine in the low chamber, although concentrations were
above those noted in the sham chamber. Inhalation of presented aero-
sols was confirmed in the medium and high groups through blood
COHb and plasma nicotine and cotinine measurements. Consequently,
comparisons can validly be made of the histopathological changes in the
difterent groups. The three biological markers of dosimetry could not

confirm exposure in the low group, where ADSS concentrations were
rnnsidered to be at or near "real-world" (Guerin et al., 1992). It is thus
very unlikely that these markers could be considered as being accept-
able for characterizing human exposures to ETS.
The increased terminal body weights in the medium exposure grnup
at the 90-day necropsy are considered to be a statistical anomaly and are
not considered to be biologically significant.
The histopathology results obtained here at 90 days are in agreement
with earlier work (von Meyerinck et at,, 1989), where only a single con-
centration of ADSS was used (4 mg/m) for 13 weeks at 10 hr/day. In the
earlier work, the main histopathological change noted was also in the

rostral nasal cavity of both rats and hamsters—a change that appears
morphologically to be very similar to that noted in the high-exposure
group in the present study. The results presented here at 4, 28. and 90
days of exposure are similar and are also in agreement with the data
presented in a 14-day study using the same concentrations and daily
durations (Coggins et al, 1992). This finding suggests a complete lack of
progression of the histopathology change with continued exposure. In
this and the Coggins et al. (1992) study the histopathology changes noted
were completely reversible once the exposures had been stopped. ror
these reasons, the epithelial hyperplasia in the nasoturbinates is consid-
ered to be an adaptive and reactive response to repeated irritation.
The exposure levels used in this study were carefully chosen with
respect to typical concentrations in real-life environments. The low expo-
sure used is typical of exposure concentrations of particulate matter in
public places where smoking is allowed without restriction, although the
contribution ot tobacco smoke to cu c h exposures has been shown to be
less than Sfl% (Guerin et al., 1992). In the present work, the contribution
of tobacco smoke to the aerosol presented to the animals was clearly
100%. The exaggerations at field values should then in reality be 2-, 20-,
and 200-told rather than 1-, 10., and 100-told. Results of a recent survey
(Turner et al., 1992) showed an overall mean value of 46 tig/m. for respir-
able suspended particulates in areas where smoking was allowed, sug-
gesting that the figure of 200 for the exaggeration of field exposures may
be an underestimate.
The results again show only a minimal ettect ot exposure to very high
concentrations of ADSS, the only effect being the completely reversible
and rionprogressive changes seen in the rostra, nasal cavity at the high
exposure only. Even with the extended durations (5 times those of the 14-
day study) no changes were reported in any organ other than the rostral
nasal cavity, and even here the change was described as being very mild.
No histopathological findings of any kind were noted at the medium or
low exposures. Since the concentrations ot smoke used were gross exag-
gerations (at least 100-told) ot any reasonable field situation for ETS
(Guerin et al., 19921, we conclude that ETS is unlikely to have any signifi-
cant toxicological activity in humans. The NOEL for the 90-clay study,
based again on nasal histopathology, is at least 1 mg/m3.

in part carcinogen DNA-adduct formation) in tobacco smokers, appears to be

'A case-control study comprising 224 male and 92 female incident lung
cancer cases and the same number of individually matched hospital controls was
conducted from June 1983 to June 1984 in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, to
evaluate the association between indoor air pollution and lung cancer risk. Guangzhou
residents were exposed to several sources of pollution in their homes, most importantly
to cooking fumes_ Increased risks were found among subjects living in a house
without a separate kitchen (the exposure odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval
(Cl) 1.4-4.2) for men and 5.9 (95%a 2.1-16.0) for women). Similarly, living in a
house with poor air circulation was associated with an exposure odds ratio of 2.1 (95%
CI 1.2-3.8) for men and 3.6 (959b CI 1.4-9.3) for women. A trend in the association
between lung cancer risk and factors pertaining to house and kitchen ventilation was
observed, and a decreasing risk of lung cancer was observed for several variables
indicating better ventilation, even after adjustment for potential confounders such as
education, occupation, living area, smoking, and history of chronic respiratory
diseases. No statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls
for frequency of cooking at home, presence of a chimney in the kitchen, or type of
cooking fuel. Smoking was clearly related to risk of lung cancer in both men and
women, and among nonsmoking women, exposure to tobacco smoke from their spouses
was also associated with an increased risk. These results suggest that, in addition to
smoking, indoor air pollution may be a risk factor for lung cancer."

SUMMARY
20 non-smokers on a defined dim low in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were exposed to en-
vironmental tobacco smoke (!TS) in an unvetuilatcd room for 8 h. Tbe urinary mutagenicity in the 24-h
trine samplm ac testoi with the :Salmonella ITA98) microsome assay did not significantN increase after
exposure to either 10 ppm CO oi V 25 ppm CO. Wc conclude that exposure of nun-smokers to E.TS
does not lead to an increase in their utinary minagenicity, provided the exposure conditions are within
a realistic range.
INTRODUCTION
A crude biomonito-ring of acute exposure to mulagenic and potentially carcino-
genic substances can be performed by measuring the mutagenicity of urine eX t rail s.
So far three stin;ies (two on men 11,21 and one on rats (39 have been published
reporting an increase in urinary mutagcnicity due to ETS exposure. Surprisingly, a
low exposure of men to EFS 121 was found to cause a much higher relative increase

in mutagenicity than an unrealistically high exposure level [II. It was the aim of our
study to measure the mutagenicity in the urine of non-smokers before and after ex-
posure to EFS, with the experimental conditions bring strictly controlled. Further-
more, i he S:olmonella typhitnurium TA98 microsome assay (Ames test) was carried
out in coded samples.
MATFRIALS AND MI ilIODS
Subjects
24 healthy male subjects (10 smokers and 14 non-smokers) aged 18 to 44 years
(mean age 22 years) volunteered to lake part in either one or both of the following
experiments.
Erperiment 1
10 non-smokers were put on a controlled diet low in PAH. During the first day
after admission (control day), the subjects stayed in an experimental room (45 m3,
2-3 ppm CO, 10-15 ppb NO, 20 ppb NO2, 20 gem' nicotine, 15-20 p.g/m3 form-
aldehyde) for 8 h. Smoking was not allowed. On the second day (exposure day) the
subjects were exposed to ETS (10 ppm CO, 160 ppb NO, 10-30 pph NO2, 40-10(1
pg/m nicotine, 40 Agirn1 formaldehyde) in the same room again for 8 h. FM was
produced by 2 smokers smoking 42 cigarettes during exposure time. Before and
after each session blood samples were drawn for COI-lb and cotinine determination.
The 24-h urine was collected for cotinine analysis and rnutagenicity testing.
Experiment 2
This experiment differed from experiment I by the level of exposure only. Two
groups of 5 non-smokers and 5 smokers each were exposed to ETS generated by the
5 smokers smoking 100 cigarettes. The levels of ETS components increased as
follows (control vs. exposure day): CO: 2-3 vs. 20-27 ppm; NO: 10-15 vs. 280-350
ppb: NO2: 15 20 vs. 130-170 ppb; nicotine: 20 vs. 120-150 Ag/in'; formaldehyde:
15-20 vs. 315-50 ftgirn'.
Methods
CO and NO/NO2 were continuously recorded on a Carbon Monoxide Analyzer
(Model 8310, Monitor Labs Inc., U.S.A.), and on a Nitrogen-Oxide Analyzer
(Model 8840, Monitor Labs Inc., U.S.A.), respectively. Nicotine and formaldehyde
were determined by capillary gas chromatography [4,51. COHb was quantified using
a CO-Oximeter (Model 182, Instrumentation Laboratories Ltd.). Cotinine in serum
and urine was measured by a rachoimmunoassay (R1A) (6). Crcatinine in urine was
detelmined by the method of Jaffe 171. For mutagenicity testing urine samples were
extracted and determined according to modified methods of Yarnasaki and Ames

were investigated for mutagenicity by the Snit/lone/id 4TA9R) microsorne (S9-mix
derived Iron] Aroclor-treated rats) assay.

The results are summarized in Table 1. COHb and cotinme in serum and urine
inci eased in non-smokers after EIS exposure, whereas no significant rise was found
in utindry mutagenicity. Using the Wilcoxon-Rank sum test, the observed increase
in mulagenicity in Exp. 2 does not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06). 11 makes
no difference whether the evaluation is based on tilt number of revenants per 24 h
or on the number of revertants per mmol creatinine. The mutagenicity in urine of
smokers is significantly elevated after smoking, hut no correlation was found be-
tween the mutagenicity and smoking parameters such as cigarettes per day. COHb
and cotinine in serum or urine. For comparison the mutagenic activities in urine
after diets poor or rich in PAH are also included [10). the urinary mutagenicity was
found to increase significantly after food rich in leafy vegetables and charcoal-
broiled meat

The exposure levs.1 leached in real-life situations may correspond to thin in Exp. 1
(II). although the dad exproNtur time is usually less than R h [121. The exposure
level in Exp. 2 is far from being realistic
Hos et at. [I] exposed 8 non-smokers to the ETS of 157 cigarettes in a poorly ven-
tilated mom for 6 h. The exposure conditions were similar to those of our Exp. 2
with.respeet to cigarettes smoked per rime unit and room volume (0.24 cig./rn Vim
in the Bos ei at. study vs. 0.27 ciginiVh in our study). On the day of exposure the
tummy mutagenicity was found to he higher than on the days before or after ex-
posure. The increase in mutation rates amonnted to about 4% of that in smokers.
This corresponds well to the rise by about 2% as found in our second experiment.
The experimental design 01 the study by Sorsa et at 121 differed from ours by ex-
posure tune and exposure level, the latter being much lower than in our first expel i-
mcnt (4 pprn CO vs. 10 pprn CO). In spite of this, the mutagenic activity in their
passive smokers increased to about 70% of that found in smokers. The extent of
this relative increase is surprisingly high and certainly in contrast to the results ob-
tained by Bos et al. 111 and by us.
As shown in Fig. 1, for both the ETS-exposed and the PAH-diet comunning sub-
jects the number of revertants induced by the urine extracts was less than twice the
spontaneous mutation rate, indicating thal the criterion of a positive test result as
established by Ames RI is not met. When testing the urine of our cigarette smokers,
however, the results were clearly positive demonstrating a high sensitivity of our ex-

mutagenicity data, which was found despite strictly controlled conditions shows that
yet unknown methodological and endogenous factors clearly outweigh the marginal
increases-in urinary mutagenicity after ETS exposure. Moreover, the relevance of
art increased tit Mary rnutagenicity with respect to cancer risk assessment is unclear
[131. These considerations support the view that measuring the mutagenic activity
in passive smokers does not lead to results that predict an increased risk to human
health.

PREFACE
This assessment of the respiratory health climes associated with passive smoking has been
prepared by the Human Health Assessment Group, Office of 1Icaith and Environmental Assessment,
Office Of Research and Development, which Ls responsible for its scientific accuracy and conclusions.
The assestment was prepared at the -equest of the Indoor Air Division, Office of Atmospheric and
Indoor Air Programs, Office of Air end Radiation, which defined its scope. and provided funding.
The ckxumenl has been developed •,indcr the authority of Title IV of Superfund (The Radon
Gas and Indoor Air Quality Research Act of 1986) to provide information and guidance on the
potential ha2.ards of Indoor air pollutants.
An earlier draft of this dOcumcn1 wa_s made available for public review and comments in June.
1990, and was reviewed by the Agency's S Acme Advisory Board in December 1990. This revision
reflects the comments received from those leviel.vs, plus additional comments from an internal review
conducted in February and March 1992,
A comprehensive search of the scientific literature for this revision is compleie thivugh
Sep:ember 1991. Iii addition, a few statlie,; published since then hove been included in response to
recommendations made by reviewers.
Due to both resource and time conaraints, the scope of this report has been limited to an
analysis of respiratory effects, prim; rily lung cancer in nonsmoking adu1ts and notienacer respiratory
illnesses in children, with emphasis on the eplderniologic data. Further, because ti.sla thorough reviews
on passive smoking were completed in 191:6 (by the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Research
Cl:Tuncil), this document provides a summary of those reports with a more comprehensive analysis Of
the literature appearing subsequent to theist: reports and an integration of the results.
It Is the Agency's intention with the release of this draft to seek additional advice from its
Science Advisory Board iti preparation for release of a final report later this year.

1. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.1. RACXGROUND
Tobacco smoking has long been recognized (e.g.. U.S. DREW, 1964) as a major cause of
mortality and morbidity. respOnsible for an estimated 434,000 deaths per year in the United State
(CDC, 1991a). Tobacco use is known to cause cancer at various sitet, in particular the lung (U.S.
DRI-1.S. 1982; IAR.C, 1986). Smoking can also cause respiratory disease (U.S. DHH.S. 1984. 1989)
and is a major risk factor for heart disease (U.S. DHHS, 1983). In recent years there has been
(-
concern that nonsmokers may also be at r isk for some of these health effects as a result of their
exposure (-passive smoking") to the tobacco smoke that occurs in variou-s environments occupied
by smokers. Although this environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is dilute compared to the
mainstream smoke (MS) inhaled by active smokers, it is chemically similar, containing many of
the sun carinogenic and toxic agents.
In 1986, the National Research Council (NRC) and the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public
Health Service independently assessed the health effects of exposure to ETS (NRC. 1986; U.S.
DI-1HS, 1986). Both of the 1986 reports conclude that ETS can cause lung cancer in adult
nonsmokers and that children of parents who smoke have increased frectuency of respiratory
symptoms and acute tower respiratory tract infections, as well as evidence of reduced lung
(unction.
More recent epidemiologie studies of the potential associations between ETS and lung
cancer in nonsmoking adults and between ETS and noncancer respiratory effects more than
double the site of the database available for analysis from that of the 1986 reports. This U.S. EPA
document critically reviews the current database on the respiratory health effects of passive
smoking, and these data are utilized to develop a hazard identification for ETS and to make
Quantitative estimates of the public health impacts of ETS for lung cancer and various other
respiratory diseases.
The weight-of-evidence analysis for the lung cancer hazard identification is developed in
eecordance with U.S. EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 986a) and
established principles for evaluating epidemiologic studies. The analysis considers animal
bioassays and genotoxicity studies, as well es biological measurements of human uptake of tobacco
smoke componenu and epiciemiologie data on active and passive smoking. The availability of
abundant and consistent human data, and especially human data at actual environmental levels of
exposure to the specific agent (mixture) or concern, allow a hazard identification to be made with

a high degree of certainty. The conclusive evidence of the dose-related lung carcinogenicity of
MS in active smokers (Chapter 4), coupled with information on the chemical similarities of MS
and ETS and evidence of ETS uptake .n nonsmokers (Chapter 5), is sufficient by itself to establish
ETS as a known human lung carcinogen, or 'Group A" carcinogen under U.S. EPA's carcinogen
clessification system. In addition, this document concludes that the overall results of 30
epidemiologic studies on lung cancer and passive smoking (Chapter 3), using spousal smoking as a
surrogate of ETS exposure for female never-smokers, similarly justify a Group A clas-sification.
The *eight-of-evidence analyses for the nuncancer respiratory effects are based prin)arill,
on review of epidemiologic studies (Chapter 7). Most of the endpoints examined are respiratory
disorders in children, where parental smoking is used 55 a surrogate of ETS exposure. For the
rioncancer respiratory effects in nonsmoking adults, most studies used spousal smoking as an
exposure surrogate. A causal association was concluded to exist for a number of respiratory
disorders where there was sofficient consistent evidence for a biologically-plausible. association
with ETS that could not be explained by bias, confounding, or chance. The fact that the database
consists of human evidence tram actual environmental exposure levels gives a high degree of
confidence in this conclusion, Where there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence or causality,
as was the case for asthma induction in children,•ETS was concluded to be a risk factor far that
endpoint. Where data were inconsistent or inadequate for evaluation of an association, as for
acute upper respiratory tract infel:tions and acute middle car infections in children. no conclusions
were drown,
This report has also attempted to provide estimates of the extent of the public health
impact, where appropriate, in terms of numbers of ETS-altributable cases in nonsmoking
subpopulations. Unlike for qualitative hazard identification assessments where information from
many sources adds to the confidence in a weight-of-evidence. conclusion, for quantitative risk
assessments the usefulnesS of studies usually depends on how closely the study population
resembles nonsmoking segments of the general population. For lung cancer estimates among U.S.
nonsmokers, the substantial epidemiology database of ETS and lung c-ancer among U.S. female
never-SMOkerb was considered to provide the most app:Ooriate information. From the large
number of similarly designed studies, pooled relative risk estimates were calculated and used in
the derivation of the population risk estimates. The large number of studies available, the
generally consistent results, and the condition of actual environmental levels of exposure increase
the confidence in these estimates. Even with these conditions, however, uncertainties remain,
such as in the use of questionnaires and current biomarker measurements to estimate past

exposure, assumptions of exposure-response linearity, and extrapolation to male never-smokers
and to exsmokers, Stitt, given the strength of the evidence for tht lung carcinogenicity or tobacco
imOke and the extensive human database from actual environmental exposure levels, fewer
essumptions are necessary than is usual in U.S. EPA quantitative risk assessments and coofidence
in these estimates is rated medium to high.
Population estimates of ETS health impacts are also made for certain noncancer respiratory
endpoints in children, specifically lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs, i.e. pneumonia,
bronchitis, and bronchioIitis) and episodes and severity of attacks of asthma. Estimates of ETS-
attributable cases of LR1 in infants and young children are thought to have .a high degree of
confidence because or the Consistent study findings and the appropriateness of parental smoking
as surrogate measure of exposure in very young children. Estimates of the number of asthmatic
children whose condition is aggravated by exposure to ETS are less certain than those for Lfels
because or different measures of outcome in various studies and because of increased
extraparental exposure to ETS in Ode children. Estimates of the number of new cases of asthma
in previously asymptomatic children also have less confidence because. at this time the weight-of-
evidence for asthma induction, while suggestive of a ceusal association, is not conclusive.
Most of the ETS population impact eStimates arc presented in terms of ranges, which are
thought to reflect reasonable assumptions about the estimates of parameters and variables required
for the extrapolation models. The validity Of the ranges is also dependent on the appropriateness
of the extrepolation models themselves.
While this report focuses only on the respiratory health effects of passive smoking, there
may also be other health effects of concern. Recent analyses of more than a dozen epidemiology
and toxicology studies (Stee.nlancl, 1992; NIOS1-1,1991) suggest that ETS exposure may be a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease. In addition, there were a few studies in the literature linking
ETS exposure to cencers of others Sites; at this time, that database appears inadequate foi any
conclusion. This report does not develop an'analysis of either the nonrespiratory cancer or the
heatt disease data and takes no position on whether ETS is a risk factor for these diseases. If it is,
the total public health impact from ETS will be greater than that discussed here.

1.2. PRIMARY FiND/NCS
A. Lung Cancer in Nonsmoking Adults
1. Passive smoking Is causally associated with lung cancer in adults, and ETS, by
the total weight-of-evidence, belongs in the category of compounds classified
by EPA as Group A (known human) carcinogens.
2. An estimated range of 2,500 to 3.300 lung cancer deaths per year among
nonsmokers (never-smokers and former smokers) of both sexes are
ettributable to ETS in the United States. The confidence in this range is
medium to high with approximately 3.000 annual iting cancer deaths
representing the best estimate.
B. Noncancer Respi -story Diseases and Disorders
1. Exposure of children to ETS from parental smoking is causally associated
with:
a. increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms of irritation
(cough, sputum, and wheeze),
b. increased prevalence of micIdle ear effusion (a sign of middle ear
disease), and
c. a small but statistically significant reduction in lung function as
tested by objective measures of lung capacity.
2. ETS exposute of young children and particularly infant from parental (and
especially mother's) smoking is causally associated with an increased risk of
lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis).
This report estimates that exposure to ETS contributes 150,000 to 300,000
lower respiratory tract infections annually in infants and children less than
I& months of age, resulting in 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations. These higher
risks continue at a decreasing rate for children until about age 3, but no
estimates are derived for children over 18 months.
3. a. Exposure to ETS is causally associated with additional episodes and
increas id severity of asthma in children who already have the disease.
This re,)ort estimates that ETS exposure exacerbates symptoms in
approximately 20% or this country's 2 million to S million asthmatic
children and is a major aggravating factor In approximately 10%.

b. In addition, the epidemiologic evidence Is suggestive but not conciusive
that ETS exposure increases the number of new cases of asthma in
children who have not previously exhibited symptoms. Based on this
evidence and the known ETS effects on both the immune system and
lungs (e.g. atopy and airway hyperresponsiveness), this report concludes
that ETS is a risk factor for the induction of asthma in previously
asymptomatic children. Data suggest that relatively high levels of
exposure are required to induce new cases of asthma in children. This
report estimates that previously asymptomatic children exposed to ETS
from mothers who smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day will exhibit a
probable range of 8.000 to 26.000 new cases of asthma annually. The
confidence in this range is medium and is dependent on the conclusion
that EIS is a risk factor for asthma induction.
4. Passive smoking has subtle but significant effects on the respiratory health of
nonsmoking adults, including coughing, phlegm, chest discomfort, and
reduced lung funeth6te
This report also has reviewed data on the relationship of maternal smoking and sudden
infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is thought to involve some unknown respiratory
pathogenesis. The report concludes that w'hile there is strong evidence that infants whose mothers
smoke are at an increased risk of dying from SIDS, available studies do not allow us to
differentiate whether and to what extent this increase is related to in utero versus postnatal
exposure to tobacco smoke products. Consequently, at this time this report is unable to assert
whether or not ETS exposure by itself is a risk factor for SIDS independent of smoking during
pregnancy. Postnatal exposure may potentiate. effects of in iite.ro tobacco smoke exposure, or it
may not have any additional effect.
Regarding an association of parental smoking with either upper respiratory tract Infections
(colds and sort throats) or acute middle ear infections in children, this report finds the evidence
inconclusive,
1.2.1. ETS and Lung Cancer
. The Surgeon General (U.S. DHHS, 1989) estimated that smoking was responsible for more
than one of every six deaths in the United States and that it accounted for about 90% of the lung
cancer deaths in males and about 80% in females in 1985. Smokers, however, are not the only

one.s exposed to tobacco smoke. Thi sidestream smoke (SS) emitted fTOM a smoldering cigarette
between puffs (the main component of ETS) has been documented to contain many of the same
carcinogenic compounds (known an I suspected human and animal carcinogens) that have been
identified in the mainstream smoke (MS) inhaled by smokers. Exposure concentrations of these
carcinogens to passive smokers are -ariable but much lower than For active smokers. An excess
cancer risk from passive smoking, however, is biologically plausible.
Based on the firmly esiablisl cd causal association of lung cancer with active smoking with
• dose-response relationship down t.-J low doses (Chapter 4), passive smoking is considered likely
to affect the lung similarly. The widespread presence of ETS in both home and workplace and its
absorption by nonsmokers in the ge sieral population have been well documented by air sampling
and by body measurement of biormrkers such as nicotine and corinine (Chapter 3). This raises the
question of whether any direct end tnce exists for the relationship between ETS exposure and
lung cancer in the general populatic and what its implications may be for public health. Thi:'
report addresses that question by re iewing and analyzing the evidence from 30 enicleiniologic
studies of effects from normr.11y oc..urring environmental levels of ETS (Chapter 5). Because
there is widespread exposure and it is difficult to construct a truly unexposed subgroup of the
general population, these studies compare individuals with higher ETS exposure to those with
lower exposures. Typically, female never-smokers v.ho are married to a smoker are compared
with femak never-smokers who an married to a nonsmoker. Some studies also consider ETS
exposure of other subjects (i.e., ma e never-smokers end long-term former smokers of either sex)
and from other sources (e.g.. workr lace and home exposure during childhood), but these studies
are fewer and represent fewer case.. and they are generally excluded front the analysis presented
here. Use of the female never- smc ker studies provides the largest, most homogeneous databane
for analysis to determine whether an ETS effect on lung cancer is present. This document
assumes that the results for female aever-smokers are generalizable to all nonsmokers.
Given that ETS exposures ve at actual environmental levels and that the comparison
groups are both exposed to appreciable background (i.e., nonspousel) ETS, any excess risk for lung
cancer from exposure to spousal smoke would be expected to be small. Furthermore, the risk of
lung cancer is relatively low in nonsmokers. and most studies have a small temple size, resultii4g in
a very low statistical power (probability of detecting a real effect if it exists). Besides small
sample size and low incremental exposures, other problems inherent in several of the studies may
also limit their ability to detect a possible effect. Therefore, this document examines the data in
several different ways. After downward adjustment of the relative risks for smoker

misclassification bias, the studies are individually assessed for strength of association and
exposure-response trend. Then the study results are Pooled by country using statistical technigues
for combining data, including both positive and nontxisitive results, to increase the ability to
determine whether or not there is en association between ETS and lung cancer. Finally, in
addition to the previous statistical analyses that weigh the studies only by size, regardless of design
and conduct, the studies are qualitatively evaluated for potential confounding, bias. and likely
iifliy to provide information about any lung carcinogenicity of ETS. 13ased on these qualitative
considerations, the studies are categorized into one of four tiers and then statistically analyzed
successively by tier.
Results from all of the analyses described above strongly support a causal association
between lung cancer and ETS exposure The overall proportion of individual studies foond to
tbov an association between lung cancer and ETS exposure is unlikely to occur by chance
(p <0.005) Similarly. the protio; tion showing a statistically significant dose-response trend
c 10-9) is highly supportive of a cauml association. Combined results by country showed
statistically significant associations for Greece (2 studies), Hong Kong (4 studies), Japan (5
studies), and the United States (I I studies), and in that order of strength of relative risk. Pooled
results of the four Western European studies (three countries) actually showed a slightly stronger
association than that of the United States. but it was not statistically significant, probably due to
the smaller sample size. The combined results of the Chinese studies do not show an association
between ETS and lung cancer; however, two or the four Chinese studies were designed mainly to
determine the lung cancer effects of high levels of other indoor air pollutants indigenous to those
areas, which would obscure a smaller ETS effect. These two Chinese studies do, however, provide
very strong evidence on the lung carcinogenicity of these other indoor air pollutants, which
contain many of the same components as ETS: When results are combined only for the other two
Chinese studies, they demonstrate a statistically significant association for ETS and lung cancer.
The relative risks for Greece end Japan of 2.00 and 1.44, respectively, are probably the
best estimates, because both female smoking prevalence and nontobacco-related lung cancer risks,
which tend to dilute the estimates of ETS effects, are low in these two countries. Also, for the
time period for which ETS exposure was or interest, spousal smoking Is considered to be a better
surrogate for ETS exposure in these societies than in Western countries, where other sources of
ETS exposure (work, public places, and other nonhome environments) are generally higher.

Based on these analyses and following the U.S, EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk
Assessment (U.S. EPA, 19862), EPA concludes that environmental tobacco smoke is a Group A
(known human) carcinogen. This conclusion is based on a total weight-of-evidence, principally:
• Biological plausibility. ETS is taken up by the lungs, and components are
distributed throughout the body. The presence of the same carcinogens in ETS
and mainstream smoke, along with the established causal relationship between
lung oencer and active smoking with the dose-response relationships exhibited
down to low doses, make it reasonable to conclude that ETS is also a lung
carcinogen.
• Supporting evidence from animal bioassays and genotoxicity experiments, The
Carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke has been established in lifetime inhalation
Studies in the hamster, intrapulmonary implantations in the rat, and skin painting
in the mouse There arc no lifetime animal Inhalation studies of ETS: however,
the carcinogenicity of ETS condensates has been demonstrated in Intrapulmonary
implantations and skin painting experiments. Positive results of geriotoxicity
testing, for both MS and ETS provide corroborative evidence for their e-arcinogenic
potential.
• Consistency of response. MI 4 of the cohort studies and 20 of the 26 case-control
Studies observed a higher risk of lung cancer among the female never-smokers
classified as exposed to ETS. Of the 17 studies judged to be or higher utility
based on study design, execution, and analysis (Appendices A and C). 15 observed
higher risks, and 6 of these increases were statistically significant, despite most
having low statistical power. Evaluation of the total study evidence from several
perspectives leads to the conclusion That the observed association between ETS
exposure and increased lung cancer occurrence is not attributable to chance.
• Broad-based evidence. These 26 case-control and 4 prospective studies provide
data from 8 different countries, employ a wide variety or study designs and
protocols, and are conducted by many different research teams. Results from all
Countries, with the possible exception of two areas of China where high levels or
other indoor air lung carcinogens were present, show small to modest increases in
lung cancer associated with spousal ETS exposure. No alternative explanatory
variables for the observed association between ETS and lung cancer have been
Indicated that would be broadly applicable across studies.

• Upward trend in dose-response. Both the lergest of the cohort studies, the
Japanese study of Hireyama--200 lung cancer cases, and the largest of the case-
control studies, the U.S. study by Fontham and associates (1991)-420 lung cancer
cases and two sets or controls, demonstrate a strong dose-related statistieal
association between passive smoking and lung cancer. This upward trend is well
supported by the preponderance of epidemiology studies. Of the total of 17
studies in which data are classified by exposure level, 11 were statistically
significant for the trend despite most having low statistical power.
• Detectable association at environmental exposure levels. Within the population of
married women who are lifelong nonsmokers, the excess lung cancer risk from
exposure to their smoking husbands' ETS is large enough to be observed.
Carcinogenic responses are usually detectable only in high-exposure
circumstances, such as occupational settings, or in experimental animate receiving
very high closes. In addition, effects are harder to observe when there is
substantial background exposure in the comparison groups, as is the case here.
• Effects remain after adjustment for potential his. Current and ex-smokers may
be misreported as never-smokers, thus inflating the apparent cancer risk for ETS
exposure. The evidence remains statistically significant and conclusive, however,
after adjustments for Smoker misclassification. For the United States, the
summary estimate of relative risk from nine case-control plus two cohort studies is
1.19 (90% confidence interval [C.1.1 e 1.04-1.35) after adjustment for
misclassification (p < 0.0$). For Greece, 2.00 (1.42, 2.83), Hong Kong, 1.61 (1.25.
2.06) and Japan, 1.44 (1.13, 1.85). the estimated relative risks are higher than those
of the United States and more highly significant after adjusting for the potential
bias.
• Confounding cannot explain the assotiation. The broad-based evidence, for an
associetion found by independent investigators across several countries, as well as
the positive dose-response trends observed in most of the studies that analyzed for
them, make any sinele confounder highly unlikely as an explanation for the
results. In addition, this report examined potential confounding factors (history of
lung disease, home heat sources, diet, occupation) and Concluded that none of
these factors could account for the observed association berween lung cancer and
ETS.

The individual risk of lung cancer from exposure to ETS does not have to be very large to
translate into a significant health hazard to the U.S. population because of the large number of
smokers and the widespread presence of ETS. Current smokers comprise approximately 26% 01
the U.S. adult population and consume more than one-half trillion cigarettes annually (1.5 packs
per day, on average), causing nearly universal exposure to at least some ETS. As a biomarker of
tobacco smoke uptake, cotinine, a mc.tabOlite of the tobacco-specific compound nicotine, is
detectable in the blood, saliva, and u-inc of persons recently exposed to tobacco smOke. Cotinine
has typically been detected in 50% to 75% of reported nonsmokers tested (50% equates to 63
nilJion U.S. nonsmokers or age 18 or above).
The best estimate of approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths per year in U.S. nonsrookeis
age 35 and over attributable to ETS (Chapter 6) is based on data pooled from all II U.S.
epiderniologic studies or never-smoking women married to smoking spouses. Use of U.S. studies
should increase the confidence in these estimates. Some mathematical modeling is required to
adjust for expected bias from misclassification of smoking status and to account for ETS exposure
from sources other than spousal smoking. Assumptions are also needed to relate responses in
female never-smokers to those in male never-smokers and ex-smokers of both sexes. and to
estimate the proportion of the nonsmoking population exposed to various levels of ETS. Overa'I,
however, the assumptions necessary fOr estimating risk add far less uncertainty than other EPA
quantitative assessments. This is because for ETS-the extrapolation Is based on a Large database or
human studies, all at levels actually expected to be encountered by much of the U.S. populatior .
The components of the 3,000 lung cancer deaths figure include approximately 1,500 female
never-SmokerS, 500 male never-smokers, and 1,000 former smokers of both sexes. More females
are estimated to be affected because there are more female than male nonsmokers. These
component est;rnates have varying degrees of confidence; the estimate or 1,500 deaths for fem:.le
never-smokers has the highest confidence because of the extensive database.. The estimate or 500
for male never-smokers is less certain because it is based on the female never-smoker response
and is thought To be low because males are generally subject to higher background ETS expolu res
than females. Adjustment for this higher background exposure would lead to higher risk
estimates. The estimate of 1,000 lung cancer deaths for former smokers of both sexes is
considered to have the lowest confidence, and the assumptions included are thought to make ti is
estimate low as well.
Workplace ETS levels are generally comparable to home ETS levels, and studies using body
cotinine measures as biomarkers demonstrate that nonhome exposures to ETS are often greater

than exposure from spousal smoking. Thus, this report presents an alternative breakdown of the
estimated 3,000 ETS-altributable lung cancer deaths between spousal and nonhome exposures. 13y
CittenSiOP or tht results from spousal smoking studies, coupled with biological measurements of
exposure, more lung cancer deaths are estimated to be attributable to ETS from combined
Donhome exposures - 2,200 of both sexes - than from spousal exposure - 800 of both sexes. This
hoe-varsus-other-sources partitioning depends on current exposure estimates that may or may
cot be applicable to the exposure period of interest. Thus, this breakdown contains this element
of uncertainty In addition to those discussed above with respect to the previous breakdown.
Other tstirnates of annual U.S. nonsmoker lung cancer deaths attributable to ETS
developed in this document give a range of 2,500 to 3,300. These other estimates use both
morteiity e.nd cotinine exposure data from the largest and best-designed U.S. study (Fontham ct
al,. 1991). Relatively small differences irt cotinine ratios, as measures of exposure from spousal
smoking, cart result in substantial variability in population risk estimates. The range suggested
ebove provides an estimetion of the uncertainty in these estimates. Overall, however, considering
the multitude, consistency, and quality of all these studies, the weight-of-evidence conclusion that
ETS is a known human lung carcinogen, and the limited amount of extrapolation necessary, thc
confidence in the estimate of approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths is medium to high.
1,2.2. ETS and Nonsaneer Respiratory Disorders
Exposure to ETS from parentel smoking has been previously linked with increased
respiratory disorders in children, particularly in infants. Several studies have confirmed the
exposure and uptake of ETS in children by assaying saliva, serum, or urine for colinine. These
cotinine concentrations were highly correlated with smoking (especially by the mother) in the
child's presence. Nine million to twelve million American children under 5 years or age, or one-
halt' to two-thirds of all children in this age group, may be exposed to cigarette smoke in the
one (Arnerkan Academy or Pediatrics, 1936).
With regard to the noncancer respiratory effects of passive smoking, this report focuses on
epidemiotogie evidence appearing since the two major reports or 1986 (NRC and U.S. 01-11-iS) that
bears on the potential association of parental smoking with detrimental respiratory effects in their
children. These effects include symptoms of respiratory irritation (cough, sputum, or wheeze):
acute diSe-ase.s Or the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis); acute
middle ear infections and indications of chronic middle ear infections (predominantly middle ear
effusion); reduced lung function (from forced expiratory volume and flow-rate measurements);

incidence and prevalence of asthma and exacerbation of symptoms in asthmatics; and acute upper
respiratory tract infections (cold, and sore throats). The more than 50 recently published studies
reviewed here essentially corroborate the previous conclusions or the NRC and Surgeon General
regarding respiratory symptoms, respiratory illnesses, and pulmonary function. and they
strengthen support for those conclusions by the additional weight-of-evidence (Chapter 7). For
example, new data on middle ear effusion strengthen previous evidence to warrant the stronger
conelusion in this report of a causal association with parental smoking. Furthermore, recent
studies establish associations between parental smoking and increased incidence of childhood
asthma. Additional research also supports the. hypotheses that in utero exposure to mother's smoke
and postnatal exposure to ETS alter lung function and structure, increase bronchial
responsiveness, and enhance the process of allergic sensitisation, changes that are known to
predispose children to early respiratory illness. Ferly respiratory illness can lead to long-term
pulmonary effects (reduced lung function and increased risk of chronic obstructive lung disease,
This document also summarizes the evidence for en association between parental smoking
and SIDS, which was not addressed in the 1986 NRC or Surgeon General reports. SIDS is the mast
common cause or death In infants ages month to I year. The cause (or causes) or SIDS is
unknown; however, it is widely believed %het some form of respiratory pathogenesis is generally
involved. The current evidence strongly suggests that infants whose mothers smoke are at an
increased risk of dying of SIDS, independent of other known risk factors for SIDS, including low
birthsveight and low gestational age, which are specifically associated with active smoking during
pregnancy. However, available studies do not allow this report to conclude whether that increased
risk is related to in utero versus postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke products, or to both.
The 1986 NRC and Surgeon General reports conclude that both the prevalence of
respiratory symptoms of irritation and the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections are
higher in children of smoking parents. In the 18 studies of respiratory symptoms subseQuent to
the 2 reports, increased symptoms (cough, phlegm, and wheezing) were observed in a range of
ages from birth to midteens, particularly in Infants and preschool children, In addition to the
studies on symptoms or respiratory irritation, nine new studies have addressed the topic of
parental smoking and acute lower respiratory tract illness in children, end eight have reported
statistically significant associations. The cumulative residence Indicates strongly that parental
smoking, especially the mother's, causes an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses from bir.h
up to the first 18 months to 3 years of life, particularly for bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and

pneumonia. Overall, the evidence confirms the previous conclusions of the NRC and Surgeon
General.
Recent studies also solidify the evidence for the conclusion of 3 causal association between
parental smoking and increased middle ear effusion in young children. Middle ear effusion is the
most common reason for hospitalization of' young children for an operation.
At the time of the Surgeon General's report on passive smoking (U.S. DHIES, Me), data
were sufficient only to conclude that maternal smoking may influence the severity or asthma in
children. The recent studies reviewed here strengthen and confirm these exacerbation effects. Ti,
edditiore the new evidence is conclusive that E,TS exposure increases the number of episodes of
asthma in children who already have the disease. It is also suggestive that ETS exposure increases
the number of new cases of asthma in children who have not previously exhibited symptoms,
although the tesults are statistically significant only with children whose mothers smoke 10 or
more cigarettes per day. While the evidence for new cases of asthma itself is not conclusive or a
causal assoeiation, the consistent strong associations of ETS with both increased frequency and
severity of the asthmatic symptoms and the established ETS effects on both the immune system
and airway hyperresponsiveness lead to the conclusion that ETS is a risk factor for induction of
asthma in previously asymptomatic children.
Regarding the effects of passive smoking on lung function in children, the 1986 Surgeon
General and NRC reports both conclude that children of parents who smoke have small decreases
in tests of pulmonary output function of both the larger and smaller air passages when compared
with the children of nonsmokers. As noted in the NRC report, if ETS exposure is the cause of the
observed decrease in lung function, the effect could be due to the direct action of agents in ETS
or an indirect consequence or increased occurrence of acute respiratory illness related to ETS.
Results from eight studies on ETS and lung function in children that have appeared since
tivosa reports add some additional confirmatory evidence suggesting a causal rather than an
indirect relationship. For the population as a whole, the reductions are small relative to the
interindividtial variability or each lung function parameter. However, groups of particularly
susceptible or heavily exposed subjects have shown larger decrements. The studies reviewed
suggest that a continuum of exposures to tobacco products starting in fetal life may contribute to
the decrements in lung function found in older children. Exposure to tobacco smoke products
inhaled by the mother during pregnancy may contribute significantly to these changes, but there
is strong evidence indicating that postnatal exposure to ETS is an important part of the Causal
pathway.

With respect to lung function effects in adults exposed to ETS, the 1986 h•FRC and Surgeon
General reports found the data at that time inconclusive, due to high interindividusl variability
and the existence of a large number of other risk factors, but compatible with subtle deficits in
lung function. Recent studies confirm the assoc.:310°n Of Passive smoking with small reductions in
lung function. Furthermore, new evidence also has emerged suggesting a subtle association
between exposure to ETS and increase-d respiratory symptoms in adults.
There is some evidence suggesting that the incidence or acute upper respiratory tract
illnesses and acute middle ear infections may be more common in children exposed to ETS..
However, several studies failed to find any effect. In addition, the possible role of confounding
factors, the lack of studies showing ele.ar dose-response relationships, and the absence of a
plausible biological mechanism preclude more definitive conclusions.
In reviewing the available evidence indicating an association (Or lack thereof) between ETS
exposure and the different noncancer respiratory disorders analyzed in this report, the possible
role or several potential confounding factors was considered. These include othe.r indoor air
pollutants; socioeconomic status: effect of parental symptoms; and characteristic-s of the exposed
child, such as low birthweight or active smoking. No single or combined confounding factors can
explain the observed respiratory effects rif passive smoking in children.
For diseases for which ETS has been either causally associated (lower respiratory tract
infections) or indicated ac a risk factor (asthma cases in previously asymptomatic children),
estimates of population attributable risk can be calculated. A population risk assessment
(Chapter 8) provides a probable range of estimates that 8,000 to 26,000 cases of childhood asthma
per year are attributable to ETS exposure from mothers who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day.
The conficienc•e in this range of estimates is medium and is dependent on the suggestive evidence
of the database. While the data show an effect only for children of these heavily smoking
mothers, additional cases due to lesser ETS exposure are also a possibility. If the effect of this
lesser exposure is considered, the range of estimates or new cases presented above increases to
13,000 to 60,000. Furthermore, this report estimates that the additional public health impact of
ETS on asthmatic children includes over 200,000 children whose symptoms are significantly
aggravated and as many as 1,000,000 children who are affected to some degree.
This report estimates that ETS exposure contributes 150,000 to 300,000 cases annually of
lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children younger than 18 months of age and that
7,900 to 15.000 of these will require hospitalization. The strong evidence linking ETS exposure to
increased incidence of bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in young children gives these

estimates a high degree of confidence. There is also evidence suggesting a smaller ETS effect on
children between ages 18 months and 3 years, but no additional estimates have been computed for
this age group. Whether or not these illnesses result in death has not been addressed here.
In the United States, more than 5,000 infants die of SIDS annually. It is the major cause of
death in Infants between the ages of 1 month end 1 year and the Sinkage with maternal smoking is
well established. The Surgeon General and World Health Organization estimate that more than
700 U.S. infant deaths per year from SIDS are attributable to maternal smoking (U.S. CDC,
1401a). However, this report concludes that at present there is not enough direct evidence
supporting the contribution of ETS exposure to declare It a risk factor or to estimate its population
impact on SIDS.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTIVE SMOKERS EX-SMOKERS. THOSE EXPOSED TO
ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE, AND THOSE NOT EXPI2SED TO TOBACCO SMOKE
by
A.J. Thornton and P.N. Lee
Data: 23rd June 1992
1. Introduction
This report concerns the extent to which smokers and non-smokers, or
individuals exposed or non-exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, differ
in the frequency with which they are exposed to various risk factors
which may affect the incidence of certain diseases. Our analyses are
based on a database collected by the Health and Lifestyle Survey [Cox et
al, 1987], from a survey of 9003 people, aged 18+, from England, Scotland
and Wales. The survey took place in 1984-1985, and was conducted in three
stages. The first stage was a questionnaire completed during an interview
at the subject's home. The second stage consisted of a visit by a nurse
approximately one week after the date of the first interview, during
which physiological measurements and simple tests of cognitive Eunction
were carried out. The third stage of the survey took the fore of a
self-completion questionnaire, designed to assess personality and
psychiatric status, which was left at the respondent's house by the
nurse.
At the first interview, information was collected on a wide range of
factors, covering aspects of self-reported health, health attitudes and
beliefs, dietary habits, leisure, work and exercise, smoking habits, and
alcohol consumption, and the subjects were also asked about their home
and family circumstances, education and income. During the home visit by
the nurse, measurements of height, weight, girth, blood pressure, pulse
rate, respiratory function, and environmental and exhaled carbon monoxide

were made, and tests of reaction time, memory and reasoning were-also
carried out. The self-completion questionnaire used three measures of
personality; namely Type A personality, neuroticism and extroversion; and
psychiatric status was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire.
Nine hundred variables per case were collected by the interview
questionnaire, 87 variables at the measurement stage of the survey, and
96 variables by the self-completion questionnaire.
So that differences in exposure to the various risk factors in
individuals exposed to different amounts of tobacco smoke could be seen,
the respondents were classified into one of four groups, depending on
their smoking habits. Never smokers were made up of people who did not
smoke themselves, and who lived in households where none of the occupants
smoked. Passive smokers were classified as those who did not actively
smoke themselves, but who lived with somebody who did, and were therefore
potentially exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. Those who had smoked
at least one cigarette per day for a minimum of six months but no longer
did so, or who had ever smoked cigars or a pipe but had given up, were
grouped as ex-smokers
while current smokers consisted of those people
who were currently smoking at least
one cigarette per day, or who
currently smoked cigars or a pipe. Respondents who smoked cigarettes, but
at a rate of less thau one per day were also classified as current
smokers, while those who had only tried to smoke a cigar or pipe once or
twice were placed in one of the other three exposure groups, depending on
their exposure to other sources of tobacco smoke.
Percentages of those exposed to each of the risk factors were
computed for Che four smoking groups. The percentages were standardised,
by the direct method, to the overall age distribution of the population
under study using six groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+) and
are presented as %A. in the tables. Differences in amount of exposure from
that in the never smoking group were tested for significance by rank
tests, stratified for age, using the method of Fry and Lee (1988).
Probability values (two-tailed) are indicated by +++, p < 0_001; ++,
p < 0.01; +, - p < 0.05; (+), (-) p < 0.1; N.S. (not significant) p
0.1, with plus (minus) signs indicating the percentage is higher (lower)
in the group in question than in the never smoker group. In addition, an
estimate of the amount of bias due to the potential confounding effect of
each risk factor was computed, as described in section 3. Due Lo the size

of the study, and lack of available time, it has not yet been possible to
analyse fully all of the data, but results from a preliminary analysis of
17 variables, covering most of the aspects of health and lifestyle
investigated by the survey, arp presented below. The variables were
chosen as being those which showed the most significant differences
between all of the four smoking groups.

2 Differences Between the Four Smoking GrOvp5
The preliminary results are presented in Table 1, which gives the
total number at risk, the age-adjusted percentages of respondents in each
category, and the direction and significance of any differences between
the four exposure groups. Table 1 also shows estimates of the amount of
bias which might arise due to smoking behaviour. It should be noted that
a given difference in distribution is more likely to be detected as
significant in women,
not only because there were more women (5098) In
total than men (3095), but also, and more so, because there were more
women (1665) than men (634) in the base group of never smokers.
Social class
For both sexes, passive, ex and current smokers were of lower social
class than never smokers (p < 0.00) for all three smoking groups).
Passive smokers were particularly unlikely to be social class I, less so
than smokers.
Alcohol consumption in previous week
The respondents were classified into categories of drinker according
to the number of units of alcohol they had consumed in the previous week.
The classification followed that used in national surveys (Dight, 1976;
Wilson, 1980), so that for men the groupings were light 1-10 units;
moderate 11-50 units; heavy 51+ units, and for women, light 1-5 units;
moderate 6-35 units; heavy 36+ units. In both sexes, ex and current
smokers were classified as heavier drinkers than never smokers (p < 0.001
for both groups). Passive smokers were also more likely to be heavier
drinkers, although less so than past or current smokers (p < 0.01 for
both sexes). Overall, women drank far less than men, with the median
number of units of alcohol consumed the previous week being 3, 1, 4 and 5
for never, passive, ex and current smokers, compared to 8, 15, 10 and 14
respectively for the men.

Number of times fried food was eaten per week
In both sexes current smokers ate fried foods more often than never
smokers (p < 0.001), while past smokers ate about the same. Passive
smokers ate fried food more often than never smokers, and this
association was stronger in women (p < 0.001) than in men (p < 0.05).
Number of times chips were eaten per week
The results for this food item were very similar to those for fried
food in general, with consumption by both male and female ex-smokers
being comparable to that of never smokers, and both passive and
current smokers consuming chips more frequently per week than never
smokers (p < 0.001 for passive and current smokers of both sexes).
Number of times sausages, meat pies and similar meat products were eaten
per week
The consumption pattern for processed meat products was similar to
that of chips and other fried food. In both sexes, passive smokers and
current smokers had a higher frequency of consumption of these products
per week (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively), while the consumption by
past smokers was no different from that by never smokers.
Number of times salads were eaten per week in summer
In contrast with the food items previously discussed, male passive
and current smokers showed a lower frequency of consumption of salads per
week in summer (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively), but past smokers
ate salads as often as never smokers. Among the women in the study, only
the current smokers showed a different pattern of consumption, being less
likely to eat salads frequently in bummer than never smokers (p < 0.001),
who ate them with a similar frequency to that of past and passive
smokers. The overall pattern of consumption of salads in winter was
similar to consumption in summer, although the frequency of consumption
was reduced, with the majority of respondents only eating salads lees
than once, or once or twice a week, in winter, compared to once or mice
a week, or most days, in summer (not shown in table).

Number of times breakrast cereal was eaten per week
Hale passive, past and current smokers all are breakfast cereal less
frequently per week than never smokers (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001
respectively). omen passive and current smokers also ale breakfast
cereal less often than never smokers (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001
respectively), but past smokers showed no difference in their consumption
of this food.
Number of cups of tea drunk per day
A higher number of cups of tea per day were drunk by men who were
passive or current smokers than men who were never smokers (p < 0_001 for
both groups), and there was also a tendency for past smokers to have a
higher coosumption of tea (p < 0.1). Only women who were current smokers
showed a higher consumption of tea (p < 0.001), w(th the number of cups
of tea drunk per day by passive and past smokers being comparable to that
of never smokers.
Amount of sugar ust-!(1 in tea
As well as drinking more cups of tea than never smokers, male
passive and current smokers were also more like)y to put sugar in these
drinks (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively). The same was true for women
passive and current smokers (p <0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively), but
unlike ex-smoking men, who showed no difference from never smokers in
their use of sugar in tea, women who were past smokers actually used less
sugar than never smokers (p < 0.05).
Number of times lam and other preserves were eaten per week
Passive, past and current smokers of both sexes had a lower
frequency of consumption of jams and similar preserves than that of never
smokers (p < 0.001, p < 0_05 and p < 0.001 for male passive, past and
current smokers respectively; p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for female
passive, past and current smokers respectively). Current smokers of both
sexes also appeared to eat other sweet foods, such as cakes, biscuits,
sweets, puddings, yogurt and ice-cream, less frequently than never
smokers (not shown in table).
566405943

Own health in general
Men who were passive, past or current smokers were all more likely
to rate their health as being poorer for someone of their age than were
never smokers (p < 0_05 for passive and past smokers, p < 0.001 for
current smokers). Female past and current smokers were also more likely
to rate their health as poorer (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively), but
women who were passive smokers showed no difference from never smokers
for this variable.
History of bronchitis
Compared with never smokers, current smokers were more likely (p <
0.05 males, p < 0.001 females) to have ever suffered from bronchitis but
passive smokers were not.. Es-smokers were also more likely to have had
bronchitis than never smokers but the difference was significant (p <
0.05) only for women.
History of depression/nervous illness
Male current smokers were more likely (p < 0.001) to have ever
suffered from this illness than never, passive or ex-smokers, who showed
no differences from each other. Among the women, current and past smokers
were more likely to have A history of the disease (p < 0.001 for both
groups), while the incidence in passive smokers was comparable to that of
never smokers.
Suffered from cold/flu during previous month
Whereas the previous two questions referred to the respondents'
entire medical history, this variable was designed to obtain information
about illness in the recent past. Men who were current or passive smokers
showed an increased incidence of colds/flu in the previous month (p <
0.01 for both groups), while ex-smokers did not show any significant
differences from never smokers. This same pattern was seen in the women
in the study,
with current and passive smokers being more likely (p <
0_01 and p < 0.05 respectively) to have suffered from colds/flu recently
than past and never smokers, who were sLmilar to each other in this
respect.

Lowest systolic blood pressure
Four measurements of systolic blood pressure were taken at one
minute intervals from each other, and the lowest value for each
respondent from any one of these four tests was used to create this
variable. The median lowest systolic blood pressures were respectively
124, 125, 130 and 127 for the men, and 120, 120, 121, and 118 for the
women. After adjustment for age, it was found that the lowest values for
men and women who were passive smokers appeared to be higher than those
for never smokers, and these differences were significant in both the men
and the women (p < 0.05 for both sexes). The lowest systolic blood
pressures of the past and current smokers were comparable to those of the
never smokers. Similar overall results were obtained for lowest diastolic
and mean arterial blood pressure (not shown in table). (N.B. The cut off
point of 140 was used to Indicate abnormal blood pressure, following WHO
(1978). For females, the significant increase for passive smokers
reflects a difference in the overall distribution, but the increase in
the prevalence of values above 140 is only small and not significant).
Do you get enough exercise?
While men who were passive smokers were more likely than never
smokers to think that. they got enough exercise (p < 0.01), men who had
given up smoking were less likely to agree with this statement (p <
0.05). Currently smoking men produced similar responses as never smokers.
Women who had given up smoking were also less likely to think that they
got enough exercise (p < 0.01), while passive and current smokers showed
no differences from never smokers In their self-assessment of the amount
of exercise they got.
Participation in physical activities in the previous fortnight
Respondents were shown a list of 17 physical sports and activities
and asked if they had taken part in any of them in the previous
fortnight. Among the men, current and past smokers were leas likely to
have taken part in any of the activities (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05
respectively), while passive &cookers were just as likely as the never
smokers to have done so. Female current smokers also appeared to take
less physical exercise than the other groups (p < 0.01), who showed no
differences from each other in their likelihood of having participated in
one or more of the activities on the list.

3. Effects of bias from confounding factors
Suppose we are comparing risk of some disease in two smoking groups,
say passive and never smokers, and suppose that we know the age-adjusted
frequencies of exposure of a three level risk factor and that the
relative risks of the disease associated with the risk factor compered to
some base level are as follows:
Exposure to
risk factor
Low
Middle
High
Never
smokers
Passive Relative
smokers risk
50% 20% 1 (base)
30% 40% 2
20% 40% 3
Compared with a population consisting of 100% subjects with low
exposure, one can readily calculate that the passive smokers would have a
relative risk of (0.20 x 1 + 0.40 x 2 + 0.40 x 3) — 2.2, while the never
smokers would have a relative risk of (0.50 x 1 + 0.30 x 2 + 0.20 x 3) —
1.7, i.e. in the absence of any true effect of passive smoking, the
passive smokers would be expected to have a risk of disease which is
higher by a factor 2.2/1.7 — 1.29 than that of the never smokers simply
due to confounding by the risk factor,
Formally, the bias due to confounding is given by
Bias — E (1'2j R )/1 E (Plj R)
where there are nlevelsofdlefactor(js.1,2_0,R.is the relative
risk associated with each level, and F2j and Plj are the frequencies of
each level in the two groups being compared.
Estimates of the frequencies are available from Table 1, but the
survey provides no data on risk of disease. Rather than try to obtain,
for various diseases, independent estimates of relative risk by level of
each risk factor studied we prefer to try to quantify potential for bias
by attempting to answer the question "Suppose exposure to the risk factor
doubled risk of a disease, how much bias due to confounding would arise
when comparing the smoking groups?" For a two level risk factor -
non-exposed (relative risk 1) and exposed (relative risk 2) - the
566405948

-12-
calculation of bias is straightforward. For two risk factors with
multiple levels, alcohol and social class, however, the calculation was
amended. In this case the procedure used was as follows:
i) choose the level of exposure which most nearly divides the

i.e. a cut-point so that the
frequency of subjects above the cut-point is as close to 50% as it
can be.
ii) assign an average relative risk of 2 to subjects above the cut-point
and 1 to other subjects.
iii) interpolate linearly, in a plot of log risk against cumulative
frequency of exposure, to assign relative risks to each level of
exposure.
The estimated values of these potential biasses are shown in Table 1
together with the assumed values of the relative risks, shown in the
column headed RR. It should be noted that though for most of the

further the magnitude of the potential bias Table 2 shows for each sax

The actual magnitude of bias for any factor will, of course, vary
depending on the strength of the relationship (if any) to the disease
being studied. However, the fact that two-fold or greater differences in
risk of various diseases have been reported in relation to exposure to
many of the risk factors studied, and the fact that biasses due to
confounding from multiple risk factors will be larger than from single
risk factors, underlines the crucial importance of careful adjustment for

Table 2 also shows that differences between passive and never
smokers are virtually always in the direction of passive smokers being
expected to have a higher risk due to exposure to other risk factors.
Thus, inter ails, passive smokers were of lower social class, drank more
alcohol, ate more fatty foods, ate less salads (and probably also
vitamins A and C, though this has still to be investigated), and had
higher blood pressure. The only significant differences in the reverse
direction were that passive smokers ate less jam and other preserves and
reported they were more likely to get 'enough exercise (although the
findings for activities in the last fortnight - see Table 1 - suggested
that they did not actually take more exercise, perhaps having a lower
requirement for 'enough").
The estimates of bias can be viewed as indices of the extent and
direction of the association between the variables and the smoking
category. It is notable that, for virtually all the significant
associations, the relationship between the variable and passive smoking
is in the same direction as that between it and current smoking, and that
the strength of the relationship for passive smoking is a substantial
part (sometimes greater) of that with current smoking. Though there are
some minor exceptions, the results suggest strongly that wherever a
significant difference between current and never smokers is reported for
some risk factor, one is likely to find a difference in the same
direction, though probably somewhat smaller, between passive and never
smokers.

4_ erleral Conclusions
Current smokers differ significantly from never smokers in exposure
to a variety of independent risk factors.
The difference is virtually always in the direction of predicting an
increased risk of disease in smokers independent of their smoking.
{Mere such a difference is seen, a difference in the same direction
is nearly always seen in relationship to passive smoke exposure.
For many risk factors, the magnitude of the difference in expusure
in relation to passive smoking is sufficient to cause bias large enough
to be important, when compared with the magnitude of the relative risk
associated with passive smoking for diseases such as lung cancer.

Exposure to 'passive smoking', or environmental tobacco

methods have been particularly difficult to use in considering

reported between active smoking and those diseases.
In the 1970's it was accepted that either the levels of
exposure or the types of exposure to ETS were such that no
significant association between ETS and lung cancer existed.
Pa the last decade, hovi.ever, there have been well oser :0

This discrepancy clearly presents some methodological pro-
blems as to which lesel Of association is correct, and tr.s
implication which approach (if either) to determining expo-

rather inconclusive debate (see Darby & Pike. 1988: ''‘‘'ald cl

Since the reviews cited above have been carried out, results
(corn a number of further epidemiological studies have been
published. These enable a revised calculation of the risk from
the epidemiological data, and one purpose of our paper is to
carry out such a revised assessment.
We show that after the now-standard 'Wald adjustment"
for differential misclassification, the two methods Carl be
reconciled to provide an estimate of the relative risk of lung

estimate of around 1,07
The conduct a the meia-analysis itself raises a number of
questions which are important in the use of this increasingly
popular tool for combining Otherwise small and insignificant
studies, and these are discussed in relation to establishing this
estimate and its significance level.

1. Cotinine. expasure to ETS and teigarette equivalents'
Cotinme is a metabolite of nicotine which is widely used as a
marker of exposure to tobacco smoke
The NRC Report (1986. p. 226i states that 'urinary coti-

for passive smoking dosimetry Datbs and Pike (1988) affirm
that counme has proved 'most useful m assessing average

(1990) agree that 'ructattne and counine are the best markers

The technique for assessing overall risk for exposure to
ETS from estimated actise srookuig ,risks using such
marker uses an extrapolation 2TINMeht We assume that the
relative risk of lung cancer occurring for acme smokers is
estimated to be BR,= I E. where E, is the known excess
nsk for active smokers, and that we wish to estimate the
relative nsk RPET, (I Eas) of exposure to ETS. where
Etrr denotes excess nsk of this exposure.
Suppose the ratio of cotioine observed in the population
exposed to ETS when compared to counine observed in
active smokers is p. Since it has been estimated fcr Daubs and
Pike (1988). NRC Report i1986)) that the half life of counine
is about Xs% longer in active smokers than in non-smokers.
if we assume that the continine ratio is duccels linearly
linked to the ratio of excess risks. we get
P = 1.SEL15 E,
There are then two parameters wnich must be estimated to
conclude this argument. namely p and Elm and both base
been subjects of some debate.
The data of Wald and Ritchie (1984) has been used by for
example. Wald et of (1986) to provide an estimate of p of
around 1% for the ratio of eottntne observed in Inc popula•
lion exposed to ETS when compared to el:airline ooser:ed in
active smokers, whilst Jarvis et of (1984) provide an estimate
of the ratio p of around 0.6% to 0.5% Lee (1991a) argues
that the higher figure of 1% is biased upwards by possible
inclusion of smoxers: Wald et cl (19910, mans that the
tower slue of 06% to 08% is invalid due to problems of
clehrutton and censoring of high values
However, assuming that this range of 0 6-1°. is at least
reasonable gives a value of Ea.% E, of 0 4% to 0 66%.
The excess risk E, for aC1Ste female smokers is vanousls

(1991d) argue that since the lesel of aCCI%C smoking is by the

active male smoking is relevant. aithouan again Lee (199th)
disputes this, and suggests that 7.3 is appropriate, being the
excess for ever-smoking males rather than current's active
smokers.
The lowest of these combinations of estimates yield a value

tobacco smoke.
This range is also supported by other approathes using
commie which have been used to evaluate rebus., nsk levels.
Darby and Pike (1988). in a detailed model of lung cancer
evoluuon. show that, if the dosage taken up by those expos-
ed to ETS is equivalent on average to active smoking of 0 1
cigarettes per day, then the reative nsk for those exposed
from age 20 to age 65 extrapolated from active srnokinv
estimates will be 1.06 (set Table 111 of Darby and Pike
(1988)). Darby and Pike ()988) ihemselses state that relative
cot/sine levels should indicate, from their detailed model, an
estemaie for excess risk of around 'one seventeenth to one
fill's' of 0.5. i.e. a value of RR,r1 of around 1.03 to 110.
The value of 0.1 'cigarette equivalents' here is at the high
end or the range put forward by Darby and Pike (1988.
p.830). although it is at the low end of the range suggested
by Vutue (1984). Repace and Lowry (1990. p. 29) assert as
reasooable an assumption or uptake of nicotine by those
snot:mod to ETS of 0.5- I% of the uptake by active smokers.
This pves effectively the same level of 'cigarette equisalent.
as that used by Darby and Pike 419881
Overall, the use of the counine argument is agreed by all
these authors to lead to a point estimate for the relative risk

around 1.03-1 10. with a 'best' value arnund RR,), of I 06

move likely to be assessed as exposed to ETS' and thus the
estunsie of relative risk of exposure to ETS will be exag-
gerated. due Ea the association of lung cancer with active
smoking for this group of 'deceivers'.
The EPA Draft Review (1990) estimated this 'spunous
excess nsk' to be approximately 0 12, and adjusted Weir
combined nsk downward by this amount We have argued
elsewhere (Tweeds. er a/. (submiiicd)) that the true extent of
this misclasstbeasion bias is actually somewhat hither than
this. and Let 11988) has an extensive discussion of the basis
for establishing an appropriate value. Ler (19910). using the
ratio of relative nsks for ETS and active SMOI.C15. asserts
that a more extensive misclassification has also taken place,
although Wald el at. (199)a.b) dispute this.
If we inapt the (possibly conservative) EPA figure then we
would adjust downwards the observed value of 1.17 from the
combined analysis to a 'true' woderlying value of RR", •a--
1.05.
A second source of potential bias in the other direction is
the possibility that the so-called 'unexposed' group is in fact
exposed to a certain amount of 'background' ETS. Such
backtround exposure might it-silt in a spunously /ow value,
in cesettrast to the orSelaSsifICation effect above Wald er a/
(1986). the NRC Repon (1916). and the EPA Draft Review
(1990) all use she following cotinine argument identical in
type to that in Section 2 to deduce the 'true' excess nsk due
to ETS exposure, over the nsk for a hypothetically complete-
ly unexposed group.
Suppose levels of cotinine are in pnnciple known for non-
smokers exposed to ETS (defined as those with smoking
spouses) and for non-smokers supposedly unexposed.
If 6 is the level of cotinine in the supposedly unexposed
if a is the level in supposed non-smokers exposed
to ETS. and if RR., is the observed relative risk for exposure
to ETS as found from epidemiological stud:es, then one may
find the true relative risk RRETT w 1 +a from solving
RR° ar• (1 + 0/(1 + 4)
Wald er al. (1986) and the NRC Report 0986), based on
data of Wald and Ritchie (1984). adopted the ratio (a/
3.0 in carrying out this analysis. The value of 3.0 is
supported to a certain extent in other -literature (sae 4- 28 of
the EPA Draft Review (1990). which justifies and adopts the
value of 3 0, and also Table 11 of Jarvis et af. (1984), which
indicate values between 2.25 and 4 as reasonable for this
ratio).
If we assume there is such a 3. fold larger excess risk for
exposed non-smokers. then the real excess nsk s are given by
finding 33 from
RRo = (1 4- 34)/(1 4.4)
If we use the value of 1.05 for RR, estimated above, then we
estimate a relative risk after adjustment on this basis of
RRE-7s 1.076
This is of course virtually identical with that found in
Section 2 from the dosimethe approach. and thus on the
basis of the most commonly accapiablc data the two methoos
appear to be essentially recoseeled
4. Methodological questions with meta-arialysis
Inclusion of studies
The question of which studies to include in a meta-analssis is
a difficult one ThaMettcally meta-analysts is valid only inso-
far as one is combining comparable 'expenments', and in
particular comparable exposures. and there is good reason to
believe that whateser 'ETS actually is, ir vs vanaole ac:oss
countries due not only to different chemical Composition of
tobacco smokes but also diffennp social customs and
corresponding levels of exposure.
One could argue that studies from China should not be
included tobacco smoking reportedly occurred on a v.lde
scale more recently there, and this may account for lov,
values such as in the recent studies of Lai ea a/ 09911 or
Wu-williams el al. (1991). Clearly these recent results
account for part of the lowering in our current estimate from
those in 1986 or even 1990 But equally one wOuid then has e

provide much of the increased overall relative risk
A separate analysis of all US studies in Table I gists an
estimated relative risk of 1,10 with a 95% Cl of (095 1.27)
This might be a More consersative and safer estimate of the
level or associaiton of EIS and lung cancer under western
concitions. although applying the Wald-EPA correction of
0 12 to this value actually reduces it below unity
It has also been suggested that inclusion of the Varciu
(1987) results, because they are onls in thesis farm and
rdauvely hard to access, is insalid. This seems an extremely
dangerous approach to meta-analysis. We have included the
results of Geng et al (1988) despite the poor Information of
the study available: the Varela (1987) study is (once located)
rairoculariy well-documented an companson to most pub
-
bawd studies, as it must be to be reviewed by thesis exam-
iners.
The real danger with any meta-analysis is the spurious
inflation of results due to omission of unpublished negative
results (sec Chalmers Ac Buyse. 1988). One must include, at
least initially, all available studies unless there is clear and
documented reason to omit them, and the analysis above
does this.
Use of adjusted tummies
There are many potential confounders of the relationship
between ETS and lung cancer: age. diet. occupation. have all
been louested as possible variables for *back results should
be adjusted. Use of such adjusted cuirasses in a meta-
analysts is usually not possible. since it contuses the relative
risks being combined unless the covanates used in adjustment
are the same across studies. In fact this is far from the case.
as is shown in Table II which gives odds ratios from raw
data, and published figures given as 'adjusted' in various
ways for covanates.
These adjustments, when given in the literature, have gone

either way. In she recent work of Sobue et al (1990). the
adjustment provides an estimate of 094 compared with a raw
figure of 1.31, the estimates of Koo et al. (1987) and Wu-
Williams er al. (1990). on quite large studies. stmalarly drop
after adjustment for covanates. and Converscly, the values of
Garfinkelei aL (1985). Gao er al. (1982) and Pershagen et at.
(lM) show increases in large studies.
The very obvious efteas of confounding that the adjusted
estimates in Table 11 indicate must he a cause of concern.
Ovezall. therefore, we have chosen as ha,.e all other reviews
to work with the raw data.
We have also not included (he three existing' cohort males
of Hirayama (l981: 1984). Gillis et al, (1911.1) or GaiiskcI
(1981), The Gillis study is too small to infloenee the resaihs.
With the other two major studies. there is a substantial
question as to whether to use ram data or age-adjusted data.
The age-adjusted results in Garfinkel 0980 are 1.18 with a
CI of (0.90. 1.54). a huge increase over the raw result of 0.53
with a 95% Cl of (0.38. 0.73). There are a alianher of 'as of
age-adjusting the Htrasama data (cf AhIboIit & Ulaerla.
/988; Tweedie (submitted)), and the lane? tetSitifi of this
gives a value of 1.15 as opposed 10 the value for non-
adjusted figures of 1.36 with a 95% Cl of (0.95. 1.96).
These arc wide vanations. and as with the case-control
studies in Table II, age-adjustment does not give uniform
change. For the same reasons that we have avoided the
adjusted figures of Table 11 we have therefore Omitted them
here, although ;has is not matenal as the age-adjusted values
do not alter the overall conclusion of our analysts.
Levels af stgrafiesuice
The inclusion of new studies has changed the point estimate
from the combined analysis from 1.42 in the EPA Draft
Review (1990) to 1.17, aiiiiimgh this is still. on the basis or
the variance from the combined analysis. an estimate which
is significant at over the 99% level.
As noted in the EPA Draft Review (1990), one can also
carry out a non-parametric lest of the significance of the
data. Figure 1 shows these odds ratios in descending order.
with the 95% confidence interval: from Table I. The iitn test
on these studies also indicates that. since only seven of 26
studies give values below 1.00. there is also 1 significant
rejection of the hypothesis of no association at the 99*/. level
on this non-parametrie basis.
Moreover, as in previous studies we find a Value from the
combined analysis which is still noticeably (if no longer
significantly) above that from the most recent evaluations of
biocherrucal marker data.
However, as observed by Wald et al. (1986), this signifi-
cance may be due to differential misclassification, and the
adjustments its the previous section take account of this. We

must then make a corresponding adjustment of the confi-

been to adjust the confidence limits themselves bs the same
amount. i.e. to propose a 95% Cl of (092. 1.14) based on
Table I. This is almost certainly lighter than is warranted.
since many of the adjusting figures arc themselves open to

level using the sign test. whilst changing the tndisidual confi-
dence intervals in this way /eases onls 7.5% of the results
significant at the 5% le-yel, which is also very consistent with
a random effect
There is clearly more work needed to deselop statistical
methods for analysing this type of adjustment method. since
the interpretation of the statistical significance of the adjusted
data is now at a very subjective level
5. Dueussion
This paper addresses two questions of on-going ImpOnance.
not only in the assessment of the relationship betueesi ITS
and occurrence of lung cancer, but also in the methodology
of evaluation of results which are inherently bights vanable
and hard to assess.
The first is in the actual level of relative risk to be ascribed
to ETS. It has been argued (Wald el at. 19916) that . .
passive smoking is a low dose exposure to a mistime of
substances that, at a high dose. is one of the best documerti-
ed and most potent causes of human cancer.' This biological
56640595?

plausibility is of course the rationale for seeking to assess, by
a number of means, whether the exposure incurred by non.
smokers does lead to a substantially irierealed relative risk.
and if so what the level is. It has thesefore caused some
considerable confusion when two apparendy valid approaches
to the problem give results which have seemingly differed by
an order of magnitude, and where to date the last word has
been the somewhat pessimistic statement by Waid Cr a.
(1991b) that it is ' . . not reasonable to expect a close
quantitative consistency ..' between the two. arid that given
the uncertainitii in both melba:It . .it is remarkabk that
the cottnine levels and the nsk estimate (from epidemiollogic.al
studies) are as concordant as they are'
There are of course very many difficulties and assumptions
in the meta-analysis method, especially in the combining of
epidemiological data. It can be criticised because of the
differences in the studies that arc being put it:Water: there is
no clear reason to believe that exposure to ETS in the United
Sates is the same exposure as in Asia. for example. nor that
the exposure kit males is the same as for females. There is
also the possibility that negative studies may be omitted
(Chalmers. 1988). leading to an overestimate based on selec.
tree inclusion of positive studies and omission of negative
studies. There are well-accepted biases due to misclassifi-
cation in individual studies, and although the Wald technique
in Section 3 is now used rounnety w adjust for these, it can
still be argued (cf Lee. 1511.4) that the study results are
even more biased and the corresponding meta-analysis esti-
mate is too high
But there are also difficulties and assumptions in the bio-
logical marker method The argument assumes that excess
nsk is linearly related to counine levels: this both assumes
that connine is an accurate quantitative measure of car-
cinogen intake if any, and moreover that it Is linearly related
to the results of such carcinogen intake. It also relies on the
current levels of connine (whicn indicate nicotine intake over
the past 2-5 days) as being accurate estimates of Inc back-
ground arid foreground exposure in the never-smokers over
their whole past history Given that lung cancers arc not a
product of short term exposures. this en(ail5 a major assurnp-
non about the relative nsks, and stability of inose risks. over
long time periods.
Repace and Lowry (1990, Section 3) provide a good dis-
cussion of the benefits and dangers inherent m using CO[Inme
to evaluate nsk„ but conclude that several authorities have
found it an 'adequate basis for exposure assessment pur-
poses'.
It is somewhat surprising, then, that studies such as the
NRC Report (1986) or Repace and Lowry (1990) adopt the
epidemiologically based value for the overall relative risk to
females for exposure to ETS. rather than the values denved
from cotinine arguments.
The aig'dnientS for its rejection Seem to be rather flimsy
Darby and Pike (1989). p. 338) feel that *it may simply be
that counine is not an adequate measuce of the exposure of
non-smokers to the carcinogenic components or cigarette
smoke'. Repace and Lowry (1990. p. 31) state that the
'expOsure-response relationship was found to be inconsistent
with the epidermology of passive smoking. and was aban-
doned' in favOur of other phenomenological approaches.
Despite this rejection of the cotininc argument for assess-
ing the overall relative risk of exposure to ETS. it nonetheless
continues to be used to make maior atiposunents for 'back-
round exposure' bias in the review payees cited above, with
an tocrease of virtually 50% in excess risk estimates based on
the biochemical argument marker as in Section 3. The logic
for this acceptance of connine in one part of the analysis and

its rejection in another is hard to support
in this paper we have shown that, using the Current
published studies of lung cancer and its association with
exposure to ETS. there is no need to reject either approach
because of the difference in results found.
We have shown that the range of estimates of 1.03-1.10
for the relative risk for exposure to ETS. as calculated by the
biological marker method in Section 2, is almost identical
with the best estimates from combined analysis of current
epidemiological studies given in Section 3. provided one
accepts the level of bias indicated for the case-control models
in the EPA Draft Review (1990). and makes a consistent use
of the counine argument to support a 50% increase tt-, the
estimate by taking into account bias from background
exposure.
This result is at variance with those in the reviews to date.
and is some five to 10-fold weaker than the estimate in the
EPA Draft Review (1990). The methodology here is identical
the only difference is in the addition of a number of new
studies.
What could cause such a change in estimates? Formally. it
is because the more recent studies include some large (and
hence presumed by the methodology to be more reliable)
recent studies with estimates of relative risk. below the
previous combined estimate. Indeed, a considerable amount
of the change is due to the inclusion of the Kabat 11990i.
Varela (1987), and Wu-Williams (1990) studies. although in
the other direction the Sobue es ei. (1990) and Fontham
(1991) studies provide a higher estimate.
Such oscillating outcomes can be confusing. and meta-
analysis properly used should enable a clearer overview of
the true picture. The second contribution of this paper is to
inclieste the caution that most be used in setting up such
arialyses„ and to caution against over-interpreting the point
estimates from the meta-analy, sis method. Our point estimate
(prior to adjustment for the two types of misclassification, is
1.1? and this seems much lower than the 1 42 of the EPA
Draft Report ((990). But the 95% confidence intervals for
these estimates are (1.06. 1.28) and (1.24, 1 63) respectivet>,
and although this indicates that the results of new studies are
overall below. what might have been expected, they are cer-
tainly not giving a loud different picture.
More substantially, however, the analysis we give shows
clearly the need to include all studies to gain an accurate
picture of the overall risk ratio
There are still acme serious methodological questions
about nuta-aoaires in the pretence of such a difficult to
measure espessuse as ETS, especially in the presence of differ-
ential miselasistfication. Mantel 41990) has argued that the
very low levels of excess risk reported in studies of ETS and
lung cancer are in the region where epidemiologleal studies
can never establish excess nsk estimates significantly above
zero. Certainly, the contribution of random error at the
current state of analysis is not at all clear.
For this reason it it important to develop other techniques
which might help estabhsh a figure with greater accuracy.
More and better controlled studies help to do this, but so do
Indirect inferential methods such as the commie marker app-
roach. It is therefore of considerable value that the different
approaches appear to be reconcilable, rather than leaving
open a subjective judgement of which to accept.

Objective.—The association between involuntary smoking and lung cancer has
been supported by most epiderrioiogic studies, but a number of authors and inter-
est groups claim that the possibility of bias has no( been excluded. Few autopsy
-
based studies have explored the role of activ e smoking and other exposures in lung
carcinogenesis, and none has been proviou.sly done to examine the role of passive
smoking. We have undertaken such an autopsy-based study in Athens, Greece.
Design.—Lung specimens were taken at ftiltopsy from 400 persons 35 years of
age or older, of both genders, who had died within 4 hours from a cause other than
respiratory or cancer in Athens or the surrounding area. For each perecin at least
seven tissue blocks were taken from the main and lobar bronchi and al west five
blocks from the parerichyma, includieg an average of about 20 smaller cartilaginous
bronchi -and membranous bronchioles. The spedniens were examined without
knowledge of The exposures of the pielicular sublect In Turin, Italy. For 283 (71%)
of the subfects the preservation of the bronchial epithelium was satisfactory for
pathological examination, and lor 20€ among them (73%) an interview could be
arranged with their next of kin, focueing on smoking hebils of the deceased and thee
spouses, as well as other variables. The inter' were were not aware of the results
of the pathological examinations.
Main Outcome Moasure.—Specimens were examined for basal cell hyperpla-
sia, squarnous cell rneteplasia, cell atypia, and (in membranous bronchioles and
bronctiokealveolar airways) ireicous cell metapJasia, in, pathological enes that
may be lung cancer risk irekeitors or epilirdel, possibly precancerous. lesions
(EPPL). The gland and vial thicknesses wece eiso measured and their ratio cal-
culated (Reid index).
Results.—In comparison with nonsmokers, EPPL values were significantly
higher among current smokers and higher, but not significantly so, among loaner
smokers.. Furthermore, EPPL values were significantly higher among deceased
nonsmoking women married to *Makers rather then lo nonsmokers. In this set of
data neither occupation rice residence was associeded with E P PL, but this Gated be
due to the poor correlation of residential history with ail:posy re -to air poeubm and
the lack of adequate elendardizationrif contemporary Greet( oecupebens The Reid
Index was higher among smokers and former snickers in °animism with nor.
smokers, among subleets with mainly urban residence in orinntartgin with those
with mainly rural residence, and among nonsmoking women marned to smokers
in comparison vethlhosernarried to nonsmokers, but none of thesedielerences was
statistireilly significant.
Corictusion.—These results providesupporf to the body of evidence linking pas-
sive smoking le lung cancer, even though they are based on a study methodolog-
ically different from those that have previously examined this association.

THE ASSOCIATION between expo-
sure to environmental tobreee smoke
and lung cancer, first reported in 1981ez
has been supported by the collective ev-
idence of several epidemiologic stud-
ies." However, lame anthereu-13 and a
number olispotial intermit groups" have
deadened the vidernklogie findings,
invong the operation of =Ilkley but
conosivabio biases. To further examine
the etiologic importance onavoinntary
smoking*: long carcieogeseds, we have
undertaken an autopey-bared epidemi
Mope study in Athens, Greece. Lung
specimens %ere examined without
knowledge of the exposures of the par-
ticular subject for pathological entities
that are considered lung =icier risk in-
diatta-s, and the endings were corre-
heed with iadependently elicited expo-
sure information concerning the de-
ceased end provided by his or her fleet
of kin.'s Several a the patbology-besed
stadies"-3' have examined the impor-
tance of tobacco srnoldrig and various
correlates of air pollution as risk factors
of patheanatornic indicators of lung can-
cer, chronic bronchitis, or reepiltorY
performance, but there have bees no
previous such inveisLigations of the role
of involuntary smoking.
METHODS
Autopsies are mandatory in Greece

During this period one of us (E.A_), a pa-

SUMMARY
Dectiscs in the mortality of monolayer cultures of L-929 cells exposed 10 sidestream (passive) smoke

having 0$7s mortality :At a concentration of 1.19% and a calculated mortality of 93624s at a concentration
of 1(()1s, The In of sito mortailly was correlated with increases in smoke age (r= -0.9999) and the resins-
sion equation was used to calculate 0 mortality al an age of 30s and 393s tool tali ty at the time of smoke

NTRODUCTIoN
A peristaltic pump smoke exposure system HI has been used to determine the
evotoxic effects of SS smoke (passive smoke) on monoLayers of mm-me L-929 cells
[2]. The results of these studies indicated that a dose response for cytotoxicity of
SS smoke existed, and that cytotoxicity of smoke decreased with increased dilution
or aging of the smoke.

high tar, non-filtered (2R1) and reduced-yield filtered, and tip-diluted (1R4F)
refeienee cigarettes, Griffith, Thomas and Hughes (Abstracts of the Tobacco
(liemists' Research Conference, Knoxville, TN, U.S.A., paper 51, 1986) developed
and reported data which permitted an evaluation of the initial results on effects of
SS smoke dilution on eytotoxicity. In addition, the results suggest the possibility
that modern cigarette design may reduce the cytotoxicity of mainstream smoke, hut
increase cytotoxicity of SS smoke.
MATEKIM.S AND mutioi)S
The smoke exixosure system
The peristaltic pump mainstrearn-sidestrearn smoke exposure system and its adap-
tation to study of cytotoxicity of smoke to monolayer tissue cultures has been
described in detail elsewhere [1, 21. Briefly, SS and mainstream smoke were col-
lected as previously described II). Age of smoke was varied by placing 2.5-cm
diameter chambers of different lengths between the smoke source and the exposed
tissue culture flasks [2].
The University of Kentucky Reference cigarette, 2RI, was used in the age and
dilution studies. This cigarette is a high-tar cigarette with no filter, designed to be
equivalent to cigarettes in use in the 1950s 131. The 1R4F cigarette is a reduced-yield
cigarette with an acetate fitter and 30% tip dilution, more porous and faster burning
paper, and, therefore, approximates modern cigarette design [3]. Cytotoxic effects
of mainstream and sidest ream smoke front the 1R4F cigarette were compared with
the effects of smoke from the 2R1 cigarette under comparable conditions.
Culture procedures
Mouse 1...929 cells, a fibroblast-like cell line, were grown to a confluent state in
Falcon 25 cm' tissue culture flasks (Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, CA). Culture and ex-
posure procedures are described in detail elsewhere [21. Control flasks of cells were
subjected to all experimental conditions except exposure, and were included in all
experiments. Viability of cell cultures was determined 24-48 h after exposure by
means of trypan blue dye CXCill!,i011. CriO mortality was calculated as follows:
(control viability — sample viability) 100
airr mortality =
control viability
Control viabilities ranged from 80-98%.
RESUl.TS
The effects of increases in concentrations of SS smoke reaching the exposure
chamber on mortality of L-929 cells was determined (Table I). As concentration of
SS smoke increased, 'Yo mortality increased (Table I). As calculated from the linear

regression curve, if the cells had been exposed to 100% of the SS smoke generated,
a hypothetical 403010 mortality would have been obseived. 1 hese initial concentra-
tions en SS smoke reaching the exposure chamber were calculated on the basis of
total SS smoke volume. When the increase in flow rate of 1.68 ml/s for a lighted
cigarette compared to an unlighted cigarette (Griffith, Thomas and Hughes,
Abstracts of the Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference, Knoxville, TN, USA,
paper 51: 1986) was used to calculate SS smoke concentration, exposure of the cells
In 10007e 01 the SS smoke generated would have resulted in a hypothetical 95620/0
mortality of the cells (Table I),
Aging of SS smoke resulted in a rapid decline in the mortality generated by the
smoke (Table II). As calculated from the linear regression curve, an increase in age
of SS smoke of 30s after generation would have resulted in a total loss of cylotoxic
effects (Table El).
When the cytotoxicity of smoke generated I roni 2R1 and 1R4F for L-929 cells was
compared, interesting results were observed (Table 111). When mainstream smoke
was generated from the cigarettes, substantially more puffs of mainstream smoke
from the 1R4F cigarette than from the 2R1 cigarette were required to induce 500/a
mortality of cells (Table III) However. for SS smoke, the situation was reversed.
Substantially more puffs of SS smoke from the 2R1 cigarette were required to in-
duce 50% mortality of cells than from the 1R4F cigarette (Table Ill).

D ISCUSSION
The results of the present study indicate that SS smoke from the 21Z1 cigarette was
extremely cytotoxic to L-929 cells. When the flow rate was corrected to take into
account the increase caused by the cigarette being lighted, the eytotoxic potential of
the SS smoke was more clearly delineated. If as little as 1.6-3cii of the SS smoke

gener ated from the 2R I sigarette reached the exposure chamber containing the cells,
very high levels of eytotoxicity were induced A calculation of the toxic effects of
SS smoke from the 2R1 cigarette indicated that if 100a/a ol the SS smoke reached
the cells in the exposure chamber, a hypothetical level ol 9562% mortality would
have been observed! Thus cakulation of the increase in SS smoke flow when the
cigarette is lighted is likely to be an underestimate of the volume of SS smoke. This
would indicate that SS smoke, freshly generated from 2R1 cigarettes, was indeed
very toxic.
The duration of this high level of cytotoxicity ol SS smoke appears to be limited.
The cytotoxic effect of SS smoke generated from the 2RI cigarette is very high at
the time the smoke is generated. I lowever, the cytotoxic effects of the smoke pro-
gressively deteriorate with age. Calculations from the data generated indicate that
by 30 s after generation of SS smoke, all cytotoxic effects should disappear. This
would suggest that SS smoke is vet y eytotoxic, but this cytotoxic effect is lost very
rapidly with aging of smoke.
1 he 1R4F cigarette is a filtered cigarette with 30% tip dilution, and compared to
the 2R1 cigarette, has a more porous faster-burning paper and a reduced yield of
tar 13J. For this reason, it was of interest to compate the cytotoxic effects of smoke
generated from the IMF cigarette with the cytotoxic effects of smoke generated
from the 2R1 cigarette. More puffs of mainstream smoke generated from the !RIF
cigarette were required to elicit 50% cytotoxicity of cells compared to mainstream
smoke generated from the 2R1 cigarette. This decreased level of cytotoxicity of
mainstream smoke from the 1R4F cigarette is what would be expected due to the
dilution of mainsti cant smoke as a result ol the tip dilution design of this cigarette
[2].
A mailer number of puffs of SS smoke generated from the 1R4F cigatette, on
the other hand, was required to generate 50% cytotoxicity than was tequired from
SS smoke generated from the 2R1 cigarette. This demonstrates a higher level of
• cytotoxicity of SS smoke from the IR,IF cigarette compared with SS smoke from
the 2R1 cigarette. The cytotoxic effects of smoke have been suggested to be due to,
in some part, the gas phase of the smoke 12, 4-61.
Usinz this model system, the cytotoxic potential of SS smoke has been
demonstrated. Future studies can be urilinci to determine how alterations in
cigarette design could altet that cytotoxic potential.

4ETERMINATIOff OF 100$E: MUTAGENS
Some reports have suggested that the potential toxicity of
ETS can be assessed by measuring Butagens in the body fluids
of nonsmokers exposed to ETS.1-3 NUtacens are substances
capable of altering the genetic structure of cells. It is
suggested that the presence of mutagens in body fluids (e.g.
urine) may be an indication that an individual has been exposed
to substances capable of inducing cancer.
Impetus for the theory arises, in part, from studies which
report that various oonstituents of ETS collected through
airborne samples are capable of inducing mutations in
bacteria.4-6
However, the significance of such reported findings has not
been established. Virtually all air samples, whether in the
presence or absence of smoking, are mutagenic. Indeed, no
substance, including
unequivocally shown
mutagenic properties.

to be free of carcinogenic and/or
In addition, it has been reported that
Aiamaream smoke exhibits
diminished mutagenic activity as it
ages and becomes diluted (i.e., as it becomes TS).7

• With few exceptions, studies which have compared mutagens in
the body fluids of nonsmokers exposed to realistic levels of
ETS and nonsmokers not exposed to ETS report no significant
difference in mutagenic activity.8-11
• The few studies reporting significant increases in urinary
mutagenicity among individuals exposed to ETS1-3 did not employ
realistic levels of exposure to ETS, and they did not control
adequately for the presence of mutagens in the diet of the
study subjects.

DOSE: OTHER BIOLOGICAL MAREERS
• It has been suggested that sidestream smoke (and by inference,
ETS) contains polvcyG3ic aromatic hvdrocarbens
substances which have been designated as carcinogens by various
governmental agencies. However, in a series of papers, German
researchers report no significant differences in urinary PAH
by-products among nonsmokers exposed to ETS and those not
exposed.1-3 Diet was reported to have a profound influence
on PA H by-product formation in all study subjects.
Japanese scientists have reported that individuals exposed to
PTS have increased urinary levels of hvdroxyproline (ROM, a
substance believed to act as a marker for the breakdown of
lung tissue .4 However, German researchers have reported no
increase in HOP excretion among either smokers or nonsmokers
exposed to ETS.5
It has recently been suggested that DNA adducts can be utilized
as biomarkers to assess exposure (dose) to ETS.6 (An adduct
is a product derived from reactions between chemicals and
biological material (such as DNA)). Research, however, does
not conclusively support this theory: nonsmokers exposed to
EIS do not appear to exhibit increased DNA adduct production.7
Other studies report no increased chromosomal changes in body

MEMORANDUM
TO: Dr. James F. Glenn
FROM: Hilda and Leonard Zahn
SUBJECT: American Heart Association, New Orleans,
Nov. 16-19, 1992
May 3, 1993
CC: BCH
A funny thing happened to antismoking activist STANTON GLANTZ
on his way to the podium at the ABA's annual meeting: he gave
only one talk there, but he got national press attention for two.
This feat was accomplished via two press releases from his in-
stitution, the University of California at San Francisco. News
stories were based on the releases, not on actual coverage of the
sessions at which the reports were presented.
Major media coverage was devoted to a report describing a
passive smoking study in animals of which Glantz was a coauthor
but which actually was given by a young colleague, YI-PING SUN;
she was mentioned only at the end of the release. (Adding to this
oddity was the fact that an Associated Press story on the study
that resulted in the national coverage was printed several days
after the paper was given.) The other Glantz paper, which he did
present, said a studs/ he led found that workplace no-smoking pol-
icies reduced the number of cigarettes smoked during the business
day and also reduced the number of smokers in the workplace.
There was considerable attention to various aspects of smoking
and heart disease at what was the largest-ever ABA meeting: more
than 31,500 attendees and about 3,700 presentations. One study
found that smokers who suffer heart attacks respond better than
do nonsmsokers to treatment with clot-busting drugs. Another pro-
ject found that smoking and stress are a dangerous duo for the
heart.
Also on the program were several reports dealing
eficial aspects of beta-carotene, a provitamin, and
and E; these substances have antioxidant properties
to protect against heart disease. Reports from two
iologic studies suggested that vitamin E may reduce
developing heart and blood vessel diseases.

And information from one of these epidemioiogic studies indi-

has been too much emphasis on findings about the hazards of low
cholesterol; they say there is no reason for the evidence in
this area to become a public policy issue. What must continue to
be stressed is that lowering total cholesterol, particularly in
persons afflicted with heart disease, is the best and only route
to pursue at present.
The highlights:
1. The study described by Sun (other coauthors besides Glantz
also were listed) was the "first laboratory evidence of the ef-
fects of passive smoking," according Lo the press release.
It quoted Glantz as saying: "This study adds significantly to
the scientific case against passive smoking. It increases the po-
tential legal liability of employers who continue to allow their
employees to be exposed to these toxins."
(Glantz and long-time collaborator WILLIAM PARMLEY have pub-
lished their estimate that environmental tohacco smoke (ETS)
causes 37,000 deaths annually in the U.S. from heart disease,
3,700 deaths from lung cancer and 12,000 deaths from other kinds
of cancers.)
Sun said the new project was conducted with rabbbits which
were fed a 0.3% cholesterol diet, randomized into three groups,
and then exposed to high or low ETS doses or served as unexposed
controls. The animals were then killed and examined.
The percent of atherosclerotic involvement of the aortic and
pulmonary arteries increased significantly as the dose of ETS
increased. There were no significant differences in blood lipids
between the three groups. Bleeding times in the two ETS-exposed
groups were shorter than in the control animals, and platelet
aggregration in the high-exposure ETS group was elevated.
The results are consistent with epidemiologic studies showing
that ETS increases the risk of death from heart disease, Sun re-
ported.
Asked to comment on the mechanism for ETS exposure and the
development of atherosclerosis, Sun said that would be difficult.
2. Smoking adversely affects arterioles, minute blood vessels
that branch out from the larger coronary arteries and nourish the
heart, and this may explain the higher risk of heart attack in
smokers, especially when they're stressed, according to ROBERT
MINOR or the Iowa Heart Institute in Des Moines.
During physical or emotional stress, arterioles may increase
blood flow to the heart by as much as four times. But this effect
was not found in smokers studied by Minor and his collegues.
They measured coronary flow reserve (the maximum capacity of
the arterioles to increase blood flow to the heart) in 31 smokers
5664059SO

3.
and 28 nonsmokers. Nonsmokers, when given drugs to dilate their
blood vessels, more than quadrupled blood supply to the heart.
However, when the same drugs were given to smokers, the arteri-
oles failed to supply even three times the normal amount of
blood.
The findings may partly explain how clgarette smoking leads to
an increased risk of heart attack in smokers, Minor said. Smoking
a single cigarette was found to temporarily raise arteriole re-
sistance (to blood flow) hy 20 percent.
"If you combine this with the chronic reduction in coronary
flow reserve, smoking may Lead to severe limitations in the
heart's blood supply, particularly during exercise or emotional
stress. This can make it easier for a heart attack to occur."
In another report at the meeting, Minor said a drug called
phentolamine, when tested in smokers, abolished the effects of
smoking on coronary flow reserve.
3. Smokers get heart attacks more often and at earlier ages
than do nonsmokers, but they respond better to treatment with
drugs that dissolve clots that block arteries.
This odd finding was reported by JEFFREY ANDERSON of LDS
Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, who described a study done on 126
smokers and 233 nonsmokers who were given one of two clot-dis-
solving drugs.
No difference was found in the effects of the agents, but the
smokers responded better than did the nonsmokers. The thromboly-
tic treatment cleared the clots in 66% of the smokers compared to
51% of the nonsmokers. Smoking was an independent predictor for
achieving complete blood flow.
The apparent paradox may result from the type of heart attack
suffered by smokers, according to Anderson. Heart attacks are
caused by plaque buildup that narrows arteries, plus a blood clot
that forms over the plaque to complete the blockage of blood
flow.
"Maybe smokers have smaller plaques and bigger clots and so
the (thrombolytic) treatment works better in them," he theorized.
4. Cigarette smoking caused endothelial dysfunction in healthy
young men and women who had no other risk factors for vascular
disease, according to DAVID CELERMAJER of the Hospital for Sick
Children, London, England. (The endothelium is the layer of epi-
thelial cells that line blood and lymph vessels, cavities of the
heart and other body organs.)
The effect of smoking on vascular tissue was seen in subjects
as young as 18, Celermajer said in reporting a study in which he
looked at arm arteries via noninvasive ultrasound technology in
subjects aged 18-'-:0 years. There were 80 smokers (42 males and 38
566405.9Si

4.
females) and 80 controls.
A parameter known as flow mediated dilation (FMD) was inverse-
ly correlated with arterial diameter in the controls. Compared Lo
controls, FMD was impaired or absent in the smokers, but a few
smokers did have normal readings. A vasodilating drug caused di-
lation in both controls and smokers.
The two most important factors seemed to be size of the blood
vessel and pack years of smoking, Celermajer said. He noted that
atherogenesis begins in early childhood or during early teen-age
years.
5. A diet low in vitamin C may be the reason why an increased
risk of heart disease is associated with ETS exposure, according
to DIANE TRIBBLE, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo
Alto, CA.
Cigarette smoke contains lots of harmful oxidants, and smokers
have decreased levels of antioxidant vitamin C, she said, adding
that cigarette sidestream smoke has more oxidants than does main-
stream smoke.
Tribble's study was done on premenopausal women aged 25-45
years; there were 44 ETS-exposed subjects, 47 active smokers, and
50 nonexposed nonsmokers. She measured expired carbon monoxide,
blood plasma levels of cotinine and vitamin C, and dietary intake
of vitamin C.
Total vitamin C intake was similar in all three groups. How-
ever, concentrations of the vitamin were significantly lower in
the active smokers and the ETS group compared to the nonsmokers
and lower in the active smokers compared to the ETS exposed sub-
jects.
High C intake might circumvent smoking-related depletion of
the vitamin, Tribble said, hut probably would not ameliorate the
physiologic consequences of the underlying oxidative stress.
6. In a related report, JoANN MUNSON, Harvard Medical School,
Boston, provided current data on antioxidant vitamin concentra-
tions and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence in women in the
Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing survey of more than 87,000 U.S.
female nurses.
She assessed the role or "totni" antioxidant score for vita-
mins C and E and carotene, each of which has been reported to
have benefits when analyzed separately.
A total of 552 CHD events (437 nonfatal heart attacks and 115
coronary deaths) have been documented so far among the nurses.
The risk for such events was lowest in those women who had the
highest total antioxidant vitamin scores. The total of all anti-
oxidants in the body appears to be a stronger predictor of CHD
566405982

5.
risk than each of the vitamins individually, Manson concluded.
7. Matnson also reported a study that linked the familiar type
A personality to heart attack through the mechanism of low HDL
concentration.
Type A personality may lower HDL levels and thereby raise the
risk of getting a heart attack, she said in describing the Boston
Area Health Study in which HDL was analyzed in 349 patients who
had suffered nonfatal heart attacks and in 359 matched controls.
Average age of the patients was 98 and 76% of them were men.
All subjects in the study underwent personal Interviews. Type
A personality Was associated with about a 50% higher risk of
heart attack than other personality types. The anger/hostility
trait appeared to have little association with risk.
Manson hypothesized that type A individuals experience high
stress, resulting in excess production of stress hormones such as
adrenaline and cortlsol; these substances have a direct effect
on
lowering HDL cholesterol.
She said the study controlled for a large number of traditional
risk factors -- snoking, high blood pressure, body weight, diabe-
tes, family history of heart disease, level of physical activity,
and alcohol intake -- but HDL was the only variable that seemed
to explain the elevated heart attack risk in the type As.
8. PETER WILSON reported some interesting findings about the
role of alcohol ingestion and cigarette smoking in regard to
levels in blood serum of HDL cholesterol and the sex hormones,
estradiol (E2) and testosterone (7).
These factors were studied in 1601 men and 1576 women who are
among the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study popu-
lation. None of the subjects was taking gonadal hormones.-The
women were about equally divided between pre- and postmenopausal
subjects. About 28% of the men and 30% of the women were smokers.
HDL levels were positively associated with E2 concentrations
and alcohol intake and negatively with smoking and body mass in-
dex, suggesting that alcohol is linked with a shift toward estro-
genization and potential protection against heart disease because
of higher HDL in both sexes.
Smoking was associated with E2 levels that were 12% lower in
men and 10% lower in women. Alcohol was associated with higher
serum E2 levels in both men and women; weekly ingestion of about
a drink a day was associated with E2 levels that were 3% higher
in men and 7% higher in women.
Men who had a drink daily had T levels that were up '%; smok-
ing was associated with 10% higher T levels while age and body
mass index showed negative associations.
566405383

6.
The favorable tendencies in E2, T2 and HDL amounts were offset
in both sexes by cigarette smoking.
9. Findings from a study of 11 healthy male smokers has
pointed to important interactions between the vascular effects of
smoking and endothelin-1 (ET), a potent vasoconstrictor, reported
WOLFGANG K1OWSKI, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.
These interactions may be deleterious in conditions associated
with high vascular resistance and in degenerative vascular pro-
cesses, he said.
In the study, Kiowski infused ET and another potent vasocon-
strictor, noradrenaline (NA), into the arm artery of the sub-
jects. He measured blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood
flow before and during infusion and repeated the measurements
after the men smoked four cigarettes.
NA and ET, in a dose-dependent manner, increased forearm vas-
cular resistance. Smoking caused increases in blood pressure and
heart rate but not in forearm blood flow. Smoking also enhanced
the vasoconstrictive effecl.s of ET, but attenuated those of NA.
Kiowski said the decreased vascular response to NA after smok-
ing might have resulted from competitive binding of the exoger-
ously administered NA with endogenously released NA.
10. HOGELIO MOSQUEDA-GARCIA, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN, described a study which, he said, produced findings opposite
to the generally held assumption that blood pressure rises during
smoking because of nicotine's effect on the sympathetic nervous
system (SNS).
The study was done in 12 volunteers who abstained from smok-
ing. Their blood pressure was measured intraarterially. _
In the control stage of the study, saline was infused into the
subjects. This was followed by one of three different intravenous
doses of nicotine to three groups of four subjects each.
Nicotine raised blood pressure and heart rate in the subjects.
No significant changes were seen in SNS or plasma norepinephrine
during or at the end of ricotine infusion; however, plasma epi-
nephrine levels were significantly elevated. (Norepinephrine and
epinephrine are powerful agents for raising blood pressure; the
former constricts capillaries and arteries; the latter in a po-
tent SNS stimulator.)
There was no inhibition of plasma norepinephrine or muscle
sympathetic nerve activity during nicotine treatment. This may
suggest that nicotine produces adaptive changes regarding pres-
sure-sensitive receptors in blood vessel walls or, alternatively,
overrides reactions by these receptors by direct stimulation that
restores sympathetic flow.

The results also suggest that nonsympathetic mechanisms con-
tribute to the pressor effect or nicotine in normal individuals.
11. Urinary cotinine levels were five times higher in children
with smoking parents than jri children whose parents did not
smoke, according to a Belgian study. The levels in the smoke-ex-
posed youngsters wore four times higher than those in nonsmoking
adults.
L.M. GALANTI of the Mount Godinne Clinic in Yvoir determined
cotinine levels in 129 children; 77 were clinic outpatients with
chronic respiratory ailments and 52 were healthy subjects from
schools and day care centers.
The children's cotinine levels correlated with those of their
parents and with the number of cigarettes smoked daily. The
children suffering from respiratory diseases may have been sub-
jected to greater smoke exposure or to increased absorption of
smoke, Galanti noted.
12. A French group reported a stady that found changes in the
coronary arteries of heavy smokers on exposure to acetylcholine
(ACh), a vasodilator and neurotransmitter that occurs naturally
in the body and can also be synthesized.
As a result, endothelial dysfunction may be an early marker
for coronary events in smokers, according to ALAIN NITENBERG of
the Paris unit or the France's National Institute of Health and
Medical Research.
The subjects were five heavy smokers (four males, one females)
and 5 age-matched nonsmoking controls (two males, three females).
All had normal coronary arteries as determined by angiography.
Also within normal ranges were blood pressures, cholesterol, Lri-
glycerides, and 11DL and low density lipoproteins.
Artery responses to ACh infusion was measured via angiography.
The smokers had an abnormal, diffuse vasoconstrictor response
which might have been due to the reduction of endothelium-derived
relaxing factor (FDRF), a potent vasodilator that also has im-
portant antipiatelet actions.
Nitenberg noted that the reduction of EDRF could result in
coronary artery construction, enhancement of platelet aggregation
and thrombosis even in vessels that were not occluded.

13. Two major studies -- one involving women, the other men --
suggest that vitamin F supplements significantly reduce the risk
of heart and blood vessel disease.
The studies, both conducted by scientists at Harvard School of
Public Health, are: the Nurses' Heulth Study, which is tracking
some 87,000 female nurses who were free of hear; disease in 1980,
and the Health Professionals Followup Study, which is following
5664059%

8.
over 45,000 men with no history of heart disease in 1986.
MEIR STAMPFER said that 17% of the nurses took vitamin E sup-
plements at some time during the 1980-1986 period. There were 552
heart attacks in that time; however, after adjusting for age,
smoking, obesity, exercise, and other risk variables, it was
found that the nurses who took E had only two-thirds the risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to colleagues who did not
take the supplement. Women who took E for more than two years had
about half the risk.
ERIC RIMM reported similar results from the study of male
health workers. After adjusting for major CVD risk factors, he
and hia associates found that men who had taken E for over two
years had a 26% lower risk of heart disease than those who did
not take the vitamin.
Stampfer said that while the evidence was- "very intriguing and
promising," he did not think it was good enough to support a
widespread recommendation that everyone should take vitamin E.
There are clinical trials being planned that will show whether
there is a genuine cause-effect relationship or the presence of
some kind of selection bias that cannot be detected.
The two studies have found that the diet does not contain
sufficient amounts of vitamin E to be of benefit. Prevention of
CVD occurred only when subjects ingested at least 100 interna-
tional units of E daily.
(A report by ISHWARLAL JIALAL., University of Texas Southwest-
ern Medical Center, Dallas, noted that addition of beta carotene
and vitamins C and E to the diet reduced the damaging effects of
low density lipoprotein (LDL), a cholesterol product believed
responsible for most of the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques.
The supplements lived up to their role us antioxidants and sig-
nificantly inhibited LDL oxidation in a study of 12 men.)
14. Despite popular belief, eating fish does not protect
against the development of heart disease. At least that's the
word from the Physicians' Health Study in which 21,185 male
doctors with no history of CVD or serious illness were enrolled
in 1982.
MARTHA MORRIS of Harvard Medical School used data from the
study to examine the controversial relationship between consump-
tion of fish and omega 3 fatty acid (fish oil) with cardiovascul-
ar events in the subjects during the period 1983 through 1988.
Intake of less than 1C0 grams daily of fish (or less than 1.5
grams daily of fish oil) did nol. reduce the risk of heart at-
tacks, stroke or cardiovascular death among the physicians.

smokers, reported EMILE MOILER, Indiana University Medical Cen-
ter, Indianapolis. (Lipid peroxidation is the dangerous process
that occurs when cholesterol products, specifically LDL, combine
with oxygen).
Mohler and his colleagues measured the amoent of exhaled pen-
tane, which is derived from omega 6 fatty acids, in the breath of
20 healthy volunteers (8 smokers, 12 nonsmokers). Smokers, when
compared to nonsmokers, were found to have significantly elevated
pentane levels and decreased levels of the antioxidants, carotene
and vitamins C and E. These antioxidants are thought to retard
the process of lipid peroxidation.
The study, according to Mohler, "provides evidence for a link
between smoking and lipid peroxidation, a possible risk factor
for the development of coronary artery disease."
16. African-American smokers can more easily abstain from
smoking or give it up because they generally are less dependent
on nicotine than Caucasian smokers, reported PAMELA CLARK, Uni-
versity of South Florida School of Medicine.
Her research group undertook a mudy of racial differences in
smoking patterns after a national stady found that 98% of black
former smokers were able to give u smoking on their own compared
to only 85 % of white participants.
Black smokers had lower scores than whites on a scale of nico-
tine addiction. Blacks had less difficulty in abstaining from
smoking in places where it was banned, smoked fewer cigarettes
daily, and had their first cigarettes later after awakening than
did white smokers.
Blacks may metabolize nicotine differently than do whites,
Clark said, and blacks also are exposed to culture factor that
help induce reduced smoking.
16. Some interesting predictors of cardiovascular death in
women have come from a '15-year followup study reported by MICHAEL
MILLER and colleagues at the University of Maryland Medical Sys-
tems and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, both in Baltimore,
MD.
Subjects of the study were 740 consecutive patients who had
diagnostic coronary angiography in 1977-1978. Independent pre-
dictors of cardiovascular mortality were diabetes mellitus (with
a relative risk of 4.0) and low HDL cholesterol (RR of 2.7). In
women free of diabetes, high triglyeeride levels were found to be
significantly linked with heart deaths after adjustment for other
factors, among them hypertension, age, race, exercise, smoking,
and total cholesterol.

INTRODUCTION
inconsistent evidence exists in thc literature concerning the recovery of rnutagens
excreted in urine after passive smoking. Fkis et al, [li reported, for the first time,
that 12-h urine of nonsmokers staying in a smoky room for 6 h was mutagenic. In
contrast, the 1985 report of Sorsa et al. Pi indicated no significant (although sug-
gestive) difference between urine mutagenicity before and after passive smoking
(their subjects were habitual smokers after a 48-72 h smoking cessation). The very
recent paper of Scherer et al. [3] indicates nort-mutagenicity of the urine of

nonsmokers who were kept on a diet low in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but
smoked passively for 8 h.
To clarify the reason(s) for the presence of these discrepancies in reports, we per-
formed an experiment on human subjects who smoked passively while being on a
semi-controlled diet.
MATERIALS AN D MI:1'1101)S
Volunteers
6 healthy volunteers, 1 male and 5 female, with no smoking experience (mean age:
24.7 ± 1.5 years; mean body weight: 56.5 ± 5.2 kg) were asked to keep to normal
Western diets excluding the consumption of alcoholic beverages, any sort of medica-
ment (except contraceptives), mid the known pro- and/or anti-mutageas such as
grilled or fried meats [4,51, ascorbic acid, tocopherol or retinol 16-81 or the
beverages that contain excess amounts of these vitamins, 24 h before and during the
experiments. Volunteers were aLso requested to avoid staying in smoky places where
smokers smoke from 24 h before the experiments began. None had an industrial oc
cupation, neither were they actively exposed to industrial chemicals.
Smoke exposure
4 habitual smokers began to smoke in a room of 48.6 ml about half an bout
before the nonsmokers were admitted into that experimental room (CO was about
15 ppm at the time of admission). All the volunteers sat around a table (one smoker
between two nonsmokers) for an 8-h exposure during which 88 cigarettes of the
same type were smoked by smokers. The cigarettes were a blond commercial filtered
type of regular size (tar yield 13 mg; nicotine yield: 0.9 mg). No ventilator was in-
stalled in the room and the door and windows were kept closed during the experi-
ment. The volunteers were allowed to leave the room repeatedly to collect their
urine. Leaving the room for a rest was not allowed. They had the same meal and
soft drinks during the experiment.
Carbon monoxide determination
CO was determined electrochemically using Ecolyzer 2400 (Energetics Science
Enc., Elm.sfold, NY).
Collection of urme samples
10-h samples of the control day were collected on the weekend avoiding the first
morning urine. On the day of exposure, any amount of urine that could be collected
before entering the experimental room was discarded. The volunteers collected their
urine during the 8-h exposure and the following 2 h when they just walked in a park
to get some fresh air. The total 10-h samples were kept frozen at —200C prior to
extraction.

the samples collected before (Table 1). An exception was the urine of subject A,
which contained more cotinine before than after exposure. In contrast, only the
urine collected after exposure was mutagenic.
DISCUSSION
Controversies are seen among the results of various authors (1-3]. which do not
permit a conclusion as to whether urine of passive smokers is mutagenic. Our results
indicate that the inconsistency or the reports is possible due to some methodical dif-
ficulties of extraction and testing procedures and/or the experimental designs. Com-
paring the results of our matagenicity assays with thosc of the cotinine
measurements, no clear correlation can be found between urine mutagenicity and
the enhancement of cotinine in urine after passive exposure to cigarette smoke.
Ol]r data, in agreement with the findings Ros et at. [11, indicate than detectable
minagens are excreted in urine alter passive smoking. The mutagenicities found with
!lie urine ol passive smokers (table 1; last column) are comparable with those of
nonsmokers after active smoking of 4 or 5 cigarettes 1101 Thus the previous
negative reports of other authors (2.3) might hint at minute shortcomings of thc ex-
perimental designs such as testing low volumes of urine 131 or admitting smoke-
experienced volunteers to play the unexperienced nonsmokers' roles during a shoti
smoking cessation 121 Urinarv excretion of mutagens depends on a variety of fac-
tots, the diet being one of them (5.121. This latter includes both pro- and anti-
muragens 14-8,12-14). A simple difficulty might arise in the recovery of urinary
minagens when the test person's consumption of dietary anti inutagerts is disregard-
ed. Additionally, endogenous for mat ion or detoxification of eareinogenic/muta-
genic compounds should not be disregarded as the contributing factors.

Summary
Sister-chromatid exchange frequencies were measured in peripheral lymphocytes of 12 cigarette smokers,
20 passive smokers, and 14 non-smokers with no regular exposure to tobacco smoke. All active and passive
smokers worked as waiters and waitresses in restaurants.
The passive smokers showed neither an increased mean SCE value nor an increased number of high SCE
frequency cells (HFCs) when compared to non-exposed non-smoke's. The incidence of SCEs and HFCs was
observed to be elevated (P<O,01; P< 0.05, resp.) among the active smokers.
The proliferation rate of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures from the different exposure groups was
also studied. The proportion of cells in first mitosis was lower and the mean replication index (RI) highet
asnong the smokers than among non-sm. oker controls. However, no significant correlation was observed
between the individual mean SCE and the replication index,
Recently, IARC (1986) evaluated the literature
and concluded that tobacco smoke is carcinogenic,
and its activity in various short-term tests could be
substantiated. Cigarette smokers show an increas-
ed frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges in
peripheral blood lymphocytes as compared with
non-smokers. The increase in SCF has been
reported to be dose-dependent with the amount of
smoking (Lambert et al., 1978; Murthy. 1979;
Hopkin and Evans, 1984; C-arrano, 1982; Husurn

1984).
The exposure to tobacco smoke is not limited to
those who smoke, but also non-smokers may be
exposed to tobacco smoke generated in the en-
vironment by smokers. Environmental tobacco
smoke mainly consists of sidestrearn smoke, which
is emitted from the burning tip of a cigarette,
whereas mainstream smoke is inhaled, and partly
exhaled, by the smoker. Although the exposure of
non-smokers to chemically altered forms of tobac-
co smoke differs to some extent from that of
smokers, many carcinogenic and mutagenic com-

pounds have been identified in higher concentra-
tions in sidestream smoke than in mainstream
smoke (e.g. U.S. DIMS, 1982). Furthermore,
severe effects on health, similar to those found in
active smokers, have also been associated with
passive smoking (see lARC, 1986. for review].
The illustrated dose-dependence of SCE in-
a eases in active smokeis implies that the biological
effects of a constant low-level exposuie to the com-
bustion prodacts ol tobacco in passive smoking
could be detected by similar methods. The ob.
served increase in the lymphocyte SCE of heavy or
moderate cigarette smokers has, however, been
small - approximately 10-30% of the non-smoker
values.
Passive smoking also constitutes a health piob-
lem in places of work. In addition to known it
ritative characteristics of environmental tobacco
smoke (Weber, 1980; U.S. DHEW, 1979), the
studies linking passive smoking with lung cancer
and other types of cancer have extended the ob-
lem in the work environment (U.S. D1THS, 19F(2.;
Collishow, 1984; 1ARC, 1986).
This study investigates the incidence of SCEs in
passive smokers as compared to that of cigarette
smokers and non-exposed non-smokers. The
passively exposed group consists of waiters and
waitresses, most of whom have been woiking in
smoky restaurants for several veal s.
In addition, proliferation of lymphocytes in
whole blood cultures from the diffeient exposure
groups was studied.
Subjects and methods
The SCE analysis was performed in one group
of smoke's and two non smoker groups. The
stnokers comprised 12 waiteis and waniesses
(5 men and 7 women; mean age 34.7 years, S.D.
11.3; cigarette consumption range 7-40 cig /day,
mean 22 cig /day) The passively exposed non-
smoker group consisted of 20 waiters and
waitresses (6 men and 14 women; mean age
38.2 yrs, S.D. 9.51 who worked 40 -± 5 h per week
in 3 restaurants which were heavily contaminated
with tobacco smoke. 14 non-exposed office
workers (2 men and 12 women; mean age 42.1 yrs,
S.). 8.61 with no reported passive exposure either
at wink or at home (4 individuals reported short
occasional passive exposure during working hours)
were included as controls. At the time of Mood
sampling, health and occupational histories were
obtained from personal interviews; the question.
naire data included information about sex, agc,
smoking status, estimation of exposure to en-
vironmental tobacco smoke, medication, radia-
tion, recent viral infections, vaccination, diet and
other life-style factors.

SCE level in exposed non-smokers (7.92 SCE per

in the non-exposed group. The incidence of SCEs
in the smoker group showed a dose-dependence:
the mean frequency in smokers who reported
smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day was 9.4
(S.D. 0.8), and 8.6 (S.D. 1.5) in those who
reported lower daily consumption' (10-19 cig.).
To evaluate further the induction of SCEs
related to tobacco-smoke exposure, a high fre-
quency cell analysis was performed for each group
on the pooled SCE scores (Carrano and Moore,
1982; MONT and Carrano, 1984). Hissed on the

28 IlFes (i.e. cells with 15 or more SCEs) as com-
pared to 16 1-11-:Cs among the passive smokers and
15 I IFCs among the non-exposed controls
(Table I). l'he difference between the active
smokers and the controls was significant (x2-test),
but the number of liFCs in the passively exposed
group did not deviate significantly from that of the
non-exposed group.
Since most of the subjects in the study were
women, the effects of active and passive tobacco
smoke exposure on SCE frequency were examined
when the data from the males were excluded.
A very similar result wa.s obtained; the mean SCE
was 9.1 SCEs per cell for actively smoking women,
8.0 SCEs per cell for passively exposed women and
7.9 for non-smoking control women.

For the smokers, the mean lymphocyte count in
peripheral blood was 3.57>' Wit, and for the
passive smokers and the non-smoking controls
3.19x109/1 and 2.57 x 109/1, respectively. Conse-
quently, the mean number of lymphocytes per
whole blood culture for each group was different
(Table 21. When the data limn the 3 exposure
groups were pooled, no significant correlation was
detected between the individual SCE frequency
and the white blood cell count or the lymphocyte
concentration in the cultures. Furthermore, neither
the mitotic index (MI) nor the replication index
(RI) correlated significantly with mean SCF fie-
gurney (SCE vs. MI, r = 0.004; SCE vs RI, r --
0.13).
Discussion
In this study, no significant increase was oh
served in the lymphocyte SCE level in the group of
non-smokers with a long-term passive exposure to
tobacco smoke. The mean SCE frequency of
cigarette smokers was significantly increased com-
pared with both the mean SCE of passive smokers
and that of the non-exposed non-smokers.
Analysis of the data using the high frequency cell
method similarly revealed only an increase in the
smoker group, as shown previously (Caftan° and
Moore, 1982; Husgafrel-Pursiainen et al., 1984);
the number of HFCs in the passive smoke's did not
differ from ihe pooled baseline value.
Morimoto et al. (1984) have reported that the
lymphocytes of passive smokers arc more sensitive
to the induction of SCE by mitomycin C treatment
than the lymphocytes from non-exposed non-
smokers. On the other hand, no difference in
baseline levels of SCEs between the exposure
groups was observed
Various biochemical intake measures have
shown that the passively exposed smokers are ex-
posed to a significantly greater extent to tobacco-
smoke constituents than the control non-smokers
(Jarvis et al., 1984; 1985). For the present passive
smokers, the concentrations of plasma thiocyanate
as well as the tobacco-sped' tc plasma and urinary
corinine were increased as compared with the non-
exposed controls (Husgafvel-Pursiainen et al.,
1986a). In addition, the air-samples taken from the
restaurants where the passive smokers worked
were found to induce mutations in bacterial tests
and SCEs in cell cultures (Husgalvel-Pursiainen et
al., 1986b1. Thus the exposure status of the
passively exposed subjects is well documented.
In the present study, the smokers had, as a
group, the highest mean value of both SCE and
RI. The individual mean SCE/cell frequencies
were not, however, dependent on RI suggesting
that pioliferation rate of the cells in culture does
not influence SCE frequency. A similar lack of
correlation was recently found by Dewdney et al.
(1986) in a SCE study of 106 subjects, by Speit et
al. (1986) in repeated cultures, and by Parkes et al.
(1985). This is in contrast to the findings of a
negative correlation by Lindblad and Lambert
(1981) and by Lambert' et al. (l981) showing that
slowly proliferating lymphocytes have higher SCE
values, as suggested also by Snope and Rarv
(1979). A positive correlation between a statistical
transformation of SCE/cell and RI was reported
by Wulf et al. (1986).
fly examining 3 groups of individuals with dif-
ferent degrees of tobacco-smoke exposure, this
study did not find an influence of passive exposure
on mean SCE level or number ol HFCs in
20 waiters and waitresses. The cigarette smokers
in the study did, however, show the highest mean
SCE and RI as well as the highest number of I1FCs
as a group. I'he negative result of the present study
suggests a need for a larger study population to
detect this type of low-level exposure.

SUMMARY
Urinary hydroxy-phenimthrene (HO-VHF) excretionin non-smokerS exposed to environmental tobac-
co smoke iFTS) is not increased. There is no significant difference in 1.10-PHE ecccretion between
Amn4c-rs (Stand non-smokers (NS). though excretion sterns to be slightly elevated in smokers. A diet rich
in po4ycydic aromatic hydrocar bons leads in a rise in urinary I10-PHE excretion as compared to a diet
tow in potycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), coming close lo significance. 1-10-PHE excretion is nca
correlated with the Mutagenic activiq iii urine.
INTRODUCTION
PAH arc thought to be a major cause of lung cancer. In 1984, Becher et at. found
a significantly higher PAH excreA ion in the urine of S as ciampare41 to NS, the dif-
ference being mart evident with regard to PHE 111. The authors measured various

PAH compounds in urine before and after reduction of the l'Al I metabolites_ The
recovery rate for PHE was rather low. In our study the hydroxylated metabolites
of PH F. were directly determined. In the following we will report on HO-PHE excre-
tion found in NS before and after exposure to ETS, in S. and in subjects on diets
differing in PAH contents.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Experiment 1
Two groups, each consisting of 5 healthy NS and 5 healthy S were put on a con-
trolled diet. During the first day after admission (control day) the subjects stayed
in an experimental room (45 rn3, 2 ppm CO, 15-20 krg/m 3 nicotine) for 8 h. Smoking
was not allowed. On the second day (exposure day) non-smokers of each group were
exposed to ET'S (100 cigarettes, 22-27 ppm CO, 100-180 ag/ml nicotine) in the same
room again for 8 h. ETS was produced by smokers smoking 100 cigarettes during
exposure time. Blood samples were drawn before and after each session for COHb
and cotinine determination. 24-h urines were collected for cotinine determination.
HO-PHE were measured in pooled 24 h urine aliquots from each group.
Experiment 2
6 healthy NS and 6 healthy S (25-44 cigarettes/day) collected their 24-h urines in
their normal environment. For the determination of cotinine, blood samples were
drawn from the subjects when returning their urine bottles. Cotinine and [O-PHE
were measured in the urine.
Experiment 3
Alter admission to the laboratory, 8 healthy non-smokers were put on a diet low
in PAH for 2 days, and on a diet rich in PAH for a further 2 days. Throughout
the 4 days the 24-h urines were collected and analysed tor HO-PH E and mutagenic
activity.
Methods
CO was continuously recorded on a CO analyzer (Model 8310, Monitor Labs
Inc., U.S.A.). Nicotine was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (2). COlib
was quantified using a CO-Oximeter (Model 182, Instrumentation Laboratories
Lrd.). Cotinine in scrum and urine was measured by radioimmunoassay I3l. HO-
PH[ in urine were quantified by gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer, Model Sigma
2B, fused silica column 25 m x 0.32 mm, SE 54; temperature programme:
tl0-i60C/10°C per min, followed by i60-280C/3°C per min, constant

Sohnonella typhimurtum was used for urinary mutagcnicity testing (TA98 4- S9

The results of Exp. 1 are shown in Table 1. On the exposure day a significant rise
in COHb and scrum col inine was observed in S and NS, whereas HO-PHE excretion
did not vary between control day and exposure day. Essentially, S differed from NS
by an elevated cotininc level in serum and in urine. However, no differences were
found between S and NS in terms of their urinary HO-PHE excretion.
To check the validity of our tesults, a second experiment was carried out. The
results are summarized in Table II. The excretion of individual HO-PHE
metabolites as well as the total excretion of HO-PHE tended to increase in S as
against NS. On the other hand, the mean volume of the 24-h urine in S was by about
Ma higher than in NS (1335.0 I 664.8 vs. 1095 ± 377.2). Since there is a signifi-
cant correlation between urine volume and HO-PHE excretion (I' = 0.7; P < 0.01)
the weak increase in HO-PIIF. excretion in smokers might partly be due to their
elciated urinary volume.
In a third experiment we investigated the effect of a diet differing in FAH con-
tents. The HO-PIIE excretion as well as the mutagenie activity in urine rose after
changing from a low- to a high-PAH diet. The increase in HO-PHE was of
borderline significance (Fig. 1). The rises in HO-PILE excretion and mutagenic ac-
tivity were not correlated.
DiSC'USSION
We conclude from our study that the contribution of EIS and even of cigarette
smoking to urinary HO-PHE excretion is small, while diet accounts for it to a larger
extent. If we assume that HO-PH N iii rue urine of S is a genera] indicator of other
PAH metabolites, our data ale in line with those of Venier et al. (7], but in contrast
to those reported by Ilechei et al. [1]. Michels and Einbrodt 18) come to the same
conclusion as that reached by Venier et al. 171 and by us; however, their values for

urinary PAH excretion appear to be extraordinarily high. In addition, we found
mutagenic activity not to be correlated with urinary 110-P11E excretion. Our data
support the findings of Venier et al., who did not observe a relationship between
urinary PA11 excretion and mutagenic activity in urine 171.
According to Husgafvel-Pursiainen et al. 19], the quantity of PH E inhaled during
an 8-h day may reach 0.04 µg (10 ng PHE/m3 x 4 m3/8 h). A smoker of 20 cigarettes
per day may inhale up 1o2 geg PHE [10J. The intake of PHE from the diet may vary
from 1.2 to 10.6 µg per day depending on the PAH content (Hoepfner et al., un-
published data). The daily urinary HO-PHE excretion of up to 6 µg as found in our
study can thus hardly be explained in terms of PI1E intake from smoking and diet
only. When we come to interpret our findings, still unknown metabolic processes
as well as methodological problems have to be discussed.

LINK BETWEEN FAT INTAKE, BREAST CANCER DEBATED IN JOURNAL
The debate over whether a diet low in fat and high in fiber actually reduces the risk of
breast cancer for middle-aged women gathered momentum last week in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
The April 14 issue contained several letters to the editor taking issue with researchers
from the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who found no
link between fat intake and breast cancer after their eight-year Nurses' Health Study
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 26, Page 33).
Dr. Ross Prentice, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash., said that
data from the Nurses' Study as well as other sources were sufficiently limited to require
"a stronger design, namely a randomized intervention trial," to reliably test the
hypothesis that a low-fat eating pattern could prevent breast and colorectal cancer and
coronary heart disease among postmenopausal women
"We have also argued that fat reduction for the prevention of these diseases constitutes
a strong hypothesis in the sense that available data sources, although far from defini-
tive, consistently suggest an association of substantial public health importance,"
Prentice wrote.
In response, the leader of the research team, Dr. Walter C. Willett, noted that other
studies "clearly provide an overall association that is very close to the null value."
"Prentice advocates a stronger study design that involves spending more than half a
billion dollars in a randomized dietary intervention trial. However, the study as cur-
rently proposed cannot confirm or refute the hypothesis that reducing fat intake will
decrease breast cancer because the probability of poor long-term compliance and the
simultaneous interventions in fiber and vitamin A intake will make any finding regard-
ing fat uninterpretable," he wrote.
Dr. Ernst Wynder and colleagues at the American Health Foundation, New York, N.Y.,
commented that the link between dietary fat and breast cancer was supported by "a
substantial body of evidence from animal and metabolic and ecologic studies."
They said the interpretation of the Nurses' Study was unwarranted because it was spe-
cifically designed to test the narrow hypothesis that the adult diet, as measured by a
self-administered, semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, was related to breast
cancer up to 10 years after assetzsment.
"Second, even if both precision and accuracy could be improved and the extremes cor-
rectly identified, the range of exposures within the study population may be too narrow
to provide an adequate test of the critical hypothesis. Furthermore, in a group of well-
educated health professionals, fully aware of participation in a study where breast can-
cer is a prominent endpoint, there is reason to suspect a systematic if unconscious bias
in favor of reporting socially desirable food consumption patterns that could lead to.-
further misclassification," they said.
Willett replied that he and his team had accounted for imprecision in the measurement
of fat intake in making their analysis.
Dr. Martin H. Cohen, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pa., suggested that
a possible confounding factor was cigarette smoking. He noted that approximately 22%
to 25% of nurses smoked.

However, Willett replied that as his team, and many others, had previously reported,
smoking was unrelated to breast cancer incidence and therefore could not confound the
lack of association between fat intake and breast cancer incidence.
Finally, Drs. Randall E. Harris and Kadarnbari Namboodiri, Ohio State University
Comprehensive Cancer Center, commented on the Nurses' Study conclusion that, after
four years of follow-up, moderate alcohol consumption was a risk factor for develop-
ment of breast cancer.
They drew attention to "an apparent diminishing temporal trend in the risk of breast
cancer associated with alcohol" in the study and said the results suggested that the
observed effect may, in fact, be transient.
"As Drs. Harris and Narnboodiri note, the association between alcohol and breast cancer
risk was less strong during the second four years of follow-up," Willett wrote in reply.
"However ... the association remained positive during the second four years of follow-up
as well as the full eight-year period," he said.

CROSS-CONTAMINATION/DIFFERENT STRAIN IN OREGON E. COLL CASES
Cross-contamination of mayonnaise with meat may have been responsible for an Oregon
outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 which has proved to be a different strain from that found in
Washington State two months ago (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, April 5, Page 60).
Dr. Katrina Hedberg, Deputy State Epidemiologist of the Oregon Health Division, said
a possible connection between mayonnaise and meat on a truck or at the restaurants
was under investigation. She added that the health problem was caused by a sub-type
different from the E. coli 0157:H7 blamed in the Washington cases.
"We should have something definitive in a few weeks. We are assuming the outbreak is
over at this point," Hedberg said, noting that the Oregon Health Division was tracing
back to see if it could find the strain in a particular herd.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta reported
from Nov. 15, 1992 through Feb. 28, 1993, more than 500 laboratory-confirmed infec-
tions with E. coli 0157:H7 and four associated deaths in four States -- Washington,
Idaho, California and Nevada.
In its April 16 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, CDC said that after the Wash-
ington outbreak, a review of medical records at San Diego hospitals revealed an overall
27% increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January
1993 compared with the same period one year earlier.
A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or
not cultured, or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli 0157:H7.
"Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition. The outbreak strain was identified in
stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen persons were hospitalized, seven developed
HUS, and one child died. The median age of case patients was 10 years," CDC reported.
In Nevada, because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC)
medium to screen stools for E. coli 0157:H7, this organism was not identified in any

There have been to date iwo approaches to dcierrnimng this ex pOSLIT C in the study or assoeial.on of passive
smoking and lung cancer: the biochemical approach. using conninc in the main as a marker, and the
epiEemiolog.cal approach. 'typically results of the former have yielded much lower relative risk than The latter.

whether this is significand!. raised
Exposure so 'passive smoking'. Or environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) is far from easy TO Measure accorately (Lee.
1911t. since it is not a direct consequence of actions of the
'exposed subjects. This means that standard research
methods have been particularly difficult to use tn considering
the level of association between ETS and occurrence of
diseases. even when strong levels of association have been
reported between active smoking and those diseases
In the 1970s it was accepted that cutter the levels of
exposure or the types of exposure to ETS were such That no
significant association between ETS and lung cancer existed.
In the last decade, however, there have been uell oser 20
published epidemiological studies which have sought to
investigate the association between exposure to ETS and lung
cancer. This epidemiological apptoach (see Sections 3. 4)
eascgorists exposure to ETS in terms or the smoking of
SPOUSas (except for Kabat. 1990 who uses home exposure)
%hen the subject evaluated is a never-smoker, and then
adjusts for now welt-established differential sampline biases.
The outcome assessed in these papers us usually occurrence of
general hong cancer. although several concentrate on or arc
dominated by one specific form of this disease (e g Tricho-
Poulos Cl 01. (1981. 1983). who exclude adenocarcinorns. or
Garfinkel (1985) whose results conversely are dominated by
adenocarcinoma): but in general all types are considered.
Individual studies usually report overall relative risks or
odds ratios and assess whether these are significantly 'sized
from unity: that is. whether there us a significantly increased
risk of lung cancer associated with ETS. In most individual
studies, relauve rusks have not been significantly raised, but
this could be due to the small St2C of the studies, and over
the past $ years there have been various evaluations using
'meta-analysis' of the overall nsk of lung cancer following
empOtiure to ETS. The two best known VC the NRC Report
ONO and Use paper by Wald eta!, (1986). There are marked
snlariiks in inter evaluations, in that both calculate a 'com-
bined tetstisv risk'. estimate the extent of bias due to differ-

problems, and esaluate significance from the confidence
le‘els established from the meta-analysis Adjusted for mis-
classification, as its Sections 3 and 4 below. The EPA Draft
Review (1990) and the recent review paper by Repace and
Lowry (1990) also follow this pattern. These meta-analyses
typically show a combined mons risk of around 0.3-0.5 for
exposure to such spousal smoking. but this has been criti-
cised largely because of the difficulties in accurate determina-
tion of exposure status (Let. 1988; Uberla. 1987).
Simultaneously with the epidemiological studies. there has
been a second and more direct approach to the problem of
estimating levels of ETS exposure. The biochemical marker
approach (see Section 21 attempts to measure iakeup of
nicotine derivatives. con‘erts this to a 'cigarette egoisaleni-
figurc. and estimates a relatise risk based on extrapolating
the observed relative nsk for active smoking
Both the NRC Report 0986) and the_EPA Draft Resies%

roach. as does the resits% tt Repace and Lowry (1990)- All
find substantia/ly lower results for the excess risk using thus
biochemical marker method of the order of 0.03-0.10. and
this is supported by a similar model-based approach of
Darby and Pike (19S5)
This discrepancy clearly presents some methodological pro-
blems as to which loci of association is correct, and by
implication which approach Of either) to determining expo-
sure is reliable. This has engendered considerable recent and
rather inconclusive debate (see Darby & Pike. 1988; V. aid rr
al., 1990; 19910.6: Lee rz at. 19910.6),
Since the reviews cited above have been carried out, result
from a number of further epidemiological studies have been
published. These enable a revised calculation of the risk from
the epidemiological data, and one purpose of our paper is to
carry out such a revised assessment.
We show that after the now-standard 'Wald adjustment'
for differential mesclasufication. the two methods can be
reconciled to provide an estimate of the relative risk of lung
cancer associaied with exposure to ETS, with a best current
estimate of around 1.07.
The conduct of the meta-analysis itself raises a number of
questions V. illCh arc imminent in the use of this inceoningly
popular tool for combining otherwise small and insignikant
studies, and these are diSetrSsed in relation to establishing this
estimate and its significance level.

2. Cohnine. exposure to ETS and 'cigarette equivalents'
Cotininc is a metabolite of nicotine which is widely used as a
marker of exposure to tobacco smoke
The NRC Report (1986. p. 226) states that •annars con-
nine is at piesent the best marker of tobacco smoke intake
for passive smoking dosimeirs'. Darby and Pike (1988) affirm
that cotintne has proved most useful in AssessinF average
daily exposure to tobacco smoke and Repace and Lowry
(1990) agree that 'nicotine and coimine are the best markers
(of exposure to ETS) currentla
The technique for assessing overall risk for exposure to
ETS from estimated active smoking msks using such a
marker uses an extrapolation atgiament. We assume that the
relative risk of lung cancer oceoteing for actor smokers is
estimated to be RR,= E. where E, is the known excess
nsk for active smokers. and that we wish to CSEIMAIC the
relative nsk RRers = (1 a- Em) of exposure to EIS. where
Eir denotes excess risk of this exposure.
Suppose the ratio of cotinine observed in the population
exposed to ETS when compared Co cotintne *Nerved in
active smokers is p. Since it has Wee estimated (ef Chub) and
Pike (19881. NRC Report (19861) that the half life of connine
is about 93% longer in active smokers than in non-smokers.
if we assume that the conunme ratio is dtrecil) linearly
linked to the (AOC of excess risks, we get
1-5 Errs E.
There are then two parameters which must be estimated to
conclude this argument. namely p and Ells. and both have
been subjects of some debate.
The data of Wald and Ritchie (1984) has been used by. for
example. wild er al. (1986) to provide an estimate of p of
around 1% for the ratio of connine observed us the popula-
tion exposed to ETS when compared to coonine observed in
active smokers. whilst Jarvis et al. 1984) provide an estimate
of the ratio p of around 0 6% to 0 8%. Lee (199(o) argues
that the hlgher figure of 1% is biased upwards by possible
inclusion of smokers. Wald el al, (199(a) araue that the
lower value or 0.6% so 0 8% is invalid due to problems of
definition and censoring of high values
However, assuming that this range of 0.6-1% is at least
reasonable gsves a value of Err, E, of 04% to 0 66%.
The excess risk E, for active female smokers is sariously
taken as seven (Wald em o.a. (1986) and the NRC Report
119$611. or 11 (EPA Draft Resins (1990)). Wald rr a/.
(1991a) argue that since the Its el of active smoking is by the
husband, the value of 11 for the excess risk of currently
active male smoking is relevant, although again Let (199(h)
disputes this, and suggests that 1 3 is appropriate. being the
excess for ever-smoking males rather than currentla active
smokers.
The lowest of these combinations of estimates yield a value
of RRLT.5.. 1.028. whilst the highest estimates give RRIrs=
1.08 for the relative risk of those exposed to environmental
tobacco smoke.
This range is also supported by other approaches using
connine which have been used to evaluate reiative risk levels
Darba and Pike (19881. in a detailed model of lung cancer
evolution. show that, if the dosage taken up by those expos-
ed to ETS is equivalent on average to active smoking of 0 1
cigarettes per day, then the relative nsk for those exposed
from age 20 to age 6$ extrapolated from active smoking
estimates will be 1 0.6 (see Table Ill of Darby and Pike
(19t811). Darby and Pike (19881 themselves state that relative
minim levels should indicate, from their detailed model, an
estimate for excess risk of around 'one seventeenth to one
fifth of 0.5, i.e. a $1.1t1C of Rftars of around 1.03 to 1.10
The value of 0.1 'cigarette equivalents' here is at the high
end of the range put forward by Darby and Pike ((988.
p.830). although it is At the low end of the range suggested
by Vutuc (1984). Repace and Lowry (1990. p.29) awn as
reasonable an assumption of uptake of nicotine by those
eXPotade ETS of 0.5-1% of the uptake by active s-mokers.
This gives effectively the same level of 'cigarette equivalent
as that used by Darby and Pike (1988).
°serail. the use of the connine argument is agreed by all
these authors to lead to 3 point estimate for the relatise risk
to females of lung cancer associated with exposure to ETS of
around 1 03-1 10. with a 'best' value around R R,„ of 1 06
being consistent with several chtleteni sources of as:ulable
publ:shed data
Cleans there Are questions open to dispuie and perhaps in
need of further and rather better data We note mita' that
although the suggested range of excess relative risks is wide
in relative terms tavola a maximum user twice the mtnimumi
for all practical imposes 1.03-1.10 is a narrow set of values
The real meihodologseal problem is that this range of %saucy
is much lower than that for the combined epidemiological
analyses of the NRC Report or the EPA Draft Resica
(19901. which are around 1.3-1.5 after adjustment for well-
established differential biases In the next section we follow
the Wald er al. (1986) metioanatysia and misclassification
adjustment approach to reevaluate these estimates with the
Inclusion of new studies. and show that in fact they cart be
reconciled with these dosimetne values.

In any one study, data may be insufficient for accurate

lack of an association but to low power of the tests used and
1c numbers in the study itself The meta-anahos approach
allows for results to be 'pooled' over a number of corn-

the real relationship to be made. There arc different technt•
dues for such pooling, but the concept has been used .idels
in recent assessment of the overall risk of passive smoking
The use of this technique for epidemiological data ALAS
pioneered in the paper by Wald ei al 09861 following its
development for clinical studies by Vusuf et at. (19831. and
the technique has been adopted in the NRC Report (191,6)
and the EPA Draft Role. ((990).
Since the NRC Report 11986) and the Wald et al it9J;6$
paper have been published. a number of further studies of
the relationship between exposure to ETS and the risk of

studies arc included in the EPA Draft Rotes% (1990).

The paper of wald et al. (1986) developed z technique for
estima ting the effect of differential bias introduced by the
misclassification of smokers at non-smokers. The NRC
Report (1986). and the EPA Draft Review (1990) followed
this methodology, with the EPA Draft Review modifsing it
somewhat to incorporate effects of misclassification of ex-
smokers direct)).
The key observation of Wald et al (19861 is that. because

snore likely to be assessed as exposed to EIS: and thus the
estimate of relative risk of exposure to EIS will be exag-
gerated. due to the association of lung cancer ssitn active
smoking for this group of 'deceivers*.
The EPA Draft Review (19901 estimated this 'stannous
excess risk" to be approximately 0 12. and adjusted their
combined risk dovinward by this amount We have argued
elsewhere fTweedie el ai. (submilteral) that the true two( or
this misclassification bias is smelly somewhat hither than
this, and Lee 09881 has an exteissive discussion of the basis
for establishing an appropriate value. Lee (199In) using the
ratio of relative nsks for ETS and active smokers, asserts
that a more extensive misclassification has also taken place,
although Wald et al (1991a.b) dispute this.
If we MeV the (possibly conservelive) EPA figure then we
would adjust downwards the observed value of 1.17 from the
combined analysis to a 'true' tmdetlying value of RRfrs
1.05.
A second source of potential bias in she other direction is
the possibilny that the so-called 'unexposed group is in fact
exposed to a certain amount of 'background' MS. Such
background exposure millit result in a spuriously tow value,
in contrast to the misclassification effect above. Wald er 01-
(1926). the NRC Report (1989). and the EPA Draft Review
0990) all use the following connine argument identical in
type to that in Section 2 to deduce the 'true' excess risk due
to ETS exposure, over Use risk for a hypothetically complete-
ly unexposed proup
Suppose levels of cotinent ate in pnrierple known for non-
smokers exposed to ETS (defined as those with smoking
spouses) and for non-smokers supposedly unexposed.
If & is the level of cotinine in the supposedly unexposed
Individuals, If a is the level in supposed non-smokers exposed
to ETS. and if RII0 is the observed relative risk for exposure
to ETS as found from epidemiological studies, then one may
find the true relative risk RR en = I -*a from solving
RA0 (I + + 4)
Wald et al. (1986) and the NRC Report (1986). based on
data of Wald and Ritchie (1984), adopted the ratio (a/
45) = 3.0 in carrying out this analysts. The value of 3 0 is
supported to a certain extent in other literature (see 4-28 of
the EPA Draft Review (1990). which justifies and adopts the
value of 30. and also Table II of Jarvis et al. (1984). which
indicate values between 2.25 and 4 as reasonable for this
ratio).
If we assume there is such a 3-fold larger excess risk for
exposed non-smokers, then the real excess risks arc given by
finding 36 from
RRor• (1 + 36);(1 -s
If we use the value or 1.05 for RRo estimated above, then we
estimate a relative risk after adjustment on this basis of
1.076.
This is of course virtually identical with that found in
Section 2 from the dosimetric approach. and thus on the
basis of the most commonly acceptable data Me two methods
appear to be essentially reconciled.
4. Mehodologkal questions nich meta-analysis
Inclusion of studies
The question of which studies to include in a meta-analysis is
a difficult one. Theoretically meta-analysts is valid onls inso-
far as one is combeams comparable 'experiments'. and in
particular comparable exposures. and 'here is good reason to
believe that whateser 'ETS' actually is 31 is variable across
countries due not only to dtfferent chemical composition of
tobacco smokes but also widely differing social customs and
corresponding levels of exposure.
One could argue that studies from China should not be
included tobacco smoking reportedly occurred on a wide
scale snore recently there, and this may account for low
values such as in he recent studies of Liu rt oi (1991) or
Wu-Williams et al. (1991) Clearly these recent results
account for part of the lowering in our curreni estimate from
those in 1986 or even 1990. But cqtsath one would then have
to consider omitting Geng er al. 119881 or Lam 0987) or
Lam (1985) on such an argument: arid these, consersels.
provide much of the increased overall relative risk
A separate analysis of all US studies in Table 1 gises an
estimated relative risk of 1.10 with a 95% Cl of (0.95. 1.271
This might be a more conservative and safer estimate or the
level of association of ETS and lung cancer under 1st-stern
conditions. although applying the Wald-EPA correction of
0.12 to this value actually reduces ii below uniti
It has alto been suggested that inclusion of the Vareta
(1987) results, because they are only in thesis form and
relatively hard to access, is insalid. This seems an extremely
dangerous approach to mesa-analysis. We_have included the

the study available: the Varela (1987) study is (once located)
particularly well-documented In comparison to most pub-
lished studies, as it muss be to be reviewed by thesis exam-
iners
The real danger with any meta-analysts is the spurious
inflation of results due to omission of unpublished negative
results (see Chalmers dr Buysc. 1988). One must include, at
least initially. all available studies unless there is clear and
documented reason to omit ahem and the analysis above
does this.
Use of adjusted estunates •''
There are many potential confounders of the relationship
between ETS and lung cancer: age, diet, occupation, have all
been sultested as possible vanables for which results should
be adjusted. Use of such adjusted esttrostes in a mesa-
analysis is usually not possible, since a coduses the relause
risks being combined unless the covanases used in adjustment
are the same across studies. In fact this is far from the case.

either way. In the recent work of Sob= et al. (1990). the
adjustment provides an estimate of 0.94 compared with a raw
filare of 1.31: the estimates of Koo et of. (1987) and Wu--
Williams et al. (199(I). on quite large studies, similarly drop
after adjustment for eovariates: and conversely, the values of
Garfinkel et at. (1985). Ga0 et of. (1987) and Pershagen et al.
(1987) show increases in large studies.
The very obvious effects of confounding that the adjusted
estimates in Table 11 indicate must bc a cause of concern.
Overall. therefore, we have chosen as have all other reviews
to work with the raw data.
We have also not included the three existing cohort studies
of Hirayama (1981: 1984). Gillis et al. (1984) or Garfinkel
(1981). The Gillis study is too small to influence the results.
With the other two major studies. there is a substantial
Question as to whether to use raw data or age-adjusted data.
The age-adjusted results in Garfinkel (1981) are 1-18 with a
Cl of (0.90. 1.34).. a huge increase over the raw result of 0.53
with a 95% Cl of (0.38. 0.73). There arc a number of ways of
age-adjusting the Hirayama data (cf Ahlborn &
1988: Tweedie (submitted)), and the latter version of this
gives a value of 1.15 as opposed to the value for non.
adjusted figures of 1.36 with a 95% Cl of (0.95. 1.96).
These are wide variations, and as with the case-control
studies in Table II, age-adjustment does not give uniform
change. For the same reasons that we have avoided the
adjusted figures of Table 11 we have therefore omitted them
here, although this is not material as the age-adjusted values
do not, alter the overall conclusion of our analysis.
Levels of significance
The inclusion of new studies has changed the point estimate
from the combined analysis from 1.42 in the EPA Draft
Review (1990) to 1.17, although this is still, on the basis of
the variance from the combined analysis, an estimate which
is significant at over the 99% level.
As noted in the EPA Draft Review (1990). one can also
carry out a non-parametric test of the significance of the
data. Figure 1 shows these odds ratios in descending order.
with the 95% confidence intervals from Table I. The sign test
on these studies also indicates that, since only seven of 26
studies give values below 1.00. there is also a significant
rejection of the hypothesis of no association at the 99% level
on this non-parametric basis.
Moreover, as in previous studies we find a value from the
combined analysis which is still noticeably (if no longer
signtficandy) above that from the most recent evaluations of
biochemical marker data.
However, as observed by Wald et al. (1986). this signifi-
cance may be due to differential misclassification. and the
adjustments in the previous section take account of this. We

must then make a corresponding adjustment of the confi-
dence interval in this method. The standard approach has
been to adjust the confidence limits themselves by the same
amount, i.e. to propose a 95% Cl of (0.92. 1.14) based on
Table I. This is almost certainly tighter than is warranted_
since many of the adjusting figures are themselves open to
error: see Mantel (19901. Indeed, one could well use the
resuits of recent studies, and the range of risks reported, as
support for the view that the previously reported results were
less accurate than the published Cls would indicate_ How-

level using the sign test. whilst changing the individual confi-
dence intervals in this way leaves only 7.3% of the results
significant at the 5% level, which is also -very consistent with
a random effect.

methods for *cabling this type of adjastment method, since

5. Discus-non
This paper addresses two questions of on-going importance.
not only in the assessment of the relationship between ETS
and occurrence of lung cancer, but also in the methodology
of evaluation of results which are inherentls highly variable
and hard to assess.
The first is in the actual level of relative risk to be ascribed
to ETS. It has been argued (Wald re al.. 1991h) that . .
passive smoking is a low dose exposure to a mixture of
substances that, at a high dose, is one of the best document-
ed and most potent causes of human cancer.' This biological

-
plausibility ts of course the rattonale for seeking to assess, by
4 a number of MCaDS. whether the exposure incurred by non-
smokers does lead to a substantially increased relative risk.
and if so what the level is. It has therefore caused some
considerable confusion when two apparently valid approaches
to the problem give iesults which hart Mattingly differed hy
an order of magnitude, and where to date the last timed has
been the somewhat pessimistic statement by Wald et a!
(1991b) that it is '. . not reasonable to expect a close
quantitative consistency ...' between the two and that given
the uncertainties in both methods '... it is remarkable that
the cotinine levels and the risk estimate (from epidemiological
studies] are as concordant as they am%
There art of course very many difficulties and assumptions
in the men-analysis method, especially in the combining of
epidemiological data. It earl be criticised because of the
differences in the studies that are being put together there is
no clear reason to believe that exposure to ETS in she United
Sates is the same exposure as irt Asia, for example, nor that
the exposure for males is the same as for females. There is
'also the possibility that negative studies may be omitted
(Clatmers, 1911), leading to an overestimate based on selec-
tits inclusion of positive studies and omission of negative
studies. There are well-accepted biases .due to misclassifi-
cation in individual studies, and although the Wald technique
in Section 3 is now used routinely to adjust for these, it can
still be argued (cf Let. 1991a.b) that the study results art
even more biased and the corresponding meta-analysts esti-
mate is too high.
But there are also difficulties and assumptions in the bio-
logical marker method. The argument assumes that excess
risk is linearly related to counine levels, this both assumes
that cotintne is an accurate quantitative measure of car-
cinogen intake if any, and moreover that it is heady related
to the results of such carcinogen intake. It also relies on the
evert/Tr levels of cotinine (which indicate nicotine intake over
she past 2-5 days) as being accurate estimates of the back-
groand and foregiound exposure in the never-smokers over
their whole past history. Given that lung cancers are not a
product of short term exposures. this entails a major assump-
tion about the relative nsks, and stability of those risks, ovc:
long ume periods.
Repace and Lowry (1990. Section 3) provide a good dis-
cussion of the benefits end duvets inherent in Miliv cotinine
to evaluate risk, but cowhide that several authorities have
found it an 'adequate basis foe exposure assesunent pur-
poses'.
It is somewhat surpnsing. then, that studies such as the
NRC Report (1986) or Repace and Lowry (1990) adopt the
epidemiologically based value for the overall relative risk to
females for exposure to ETS. rather than the values derived
from cotinine arguments.
The arguments for its rejection seem to be rather flimsy
Darby and Pike (1989), p.338) feel that 'it may simply be
that cotinine is not an adequate measure of the exposure of
non-smokers to the carcinogenic components of cigarette
smoke'. Repace and Lowry (1990, p.31) state that the
exposure-response relationship was found so be inconsistent
with the epidemiology of passive smoking, and was aban-
doned* in favour of other phenomenological approaches.
Despite this rejection of the cotinine argument for assess-
* the overall relative risk of exposure to ETS. it nonetheless
continues to be used to make major adjustments for 'back-
ground exposure' bias in the review papers cited above, with
an increase of virtually 50% in excess risk estimates based on
the btochernic-al argument marker as in Section 3 The logic

its rejecuon in another is hard to support.
In this paper we have shown that, using the current
published studies of lung cancer and its assoclatton with
exposure to ETS, there is no need to reject either approach
because of the difference in results found.
We have shown that the range of estimates of 1 03- 1.10
for the relative nsk for exposure to ETS. as calculated by the
biological marker method in Section 7. is almost identical
with the best estimates from combined analysts of current
epidemiological studies given in Section 3. provided one
accepts the level of bias indicated for the case-control mode's
in the f.PA Draft Review (1990), and makes a consistent use
of the count= argument to support a 50% increase in the
estimate by taking into account bias from background
exposure.
This result is at variance with those in the reviews to date.
and is some five to 10-fold weaker than the estimate in the.
EPA Draft Review (1990). The methodology here is identical
the only difference is in the addittoo of a number of nes,
studies.
What could cause such a change in estimates? Formally. it
is because the more recent studies include some large (and
hence presumed by the methodology to be more reliable)
recent studies with estimates of relative risk below the
previous combined estimate. Indeed, a considerable amount
of the change is due to the inclusion of the Kabat 11990i.
Varela (1987), and Wu-Williams (1990) studies, although in
the ocher direction the Sobuc et of. (1990) and Fontham
(1991) studies provide a higher estimate
Such oscillating outcomes can be confusing, and meta.
analysis properly used should enable a clearer overview of
the true picture. The second contribution of this papei is to
indicate the caution that must be used in setting up such
analyses, arid to caution against over-interpreting the point
estimates from the meta-analysis method. Our point estimate
(prior to adjustment for the two types of misclassification) is
1.17 and this seems much lower than the 1.47 of the EPA
Draft Report (1990) But the 95% confidence Intenals for
these estimates arc (1 Oth 1.28) and (1 24. 1.63) respectisely.
and although this indicates that the results of new studies are
overall below what might have been expected. they are cer-
tainly not Flying a total different picture
More substantially. however, the analysis we give shows
clearly the need to include all studies to gain an accurate
picture of the overall nsk ratio.
There arc still some serious methodological questions
about meta-analysis in the presence of such a difficult to
measure exposure as ETS. especially in the presence of differ-
ential misclassification. Mantel (1990) has atsased that the
very low kWh of excess risk reported in steaks of ETS and
lung cancer ate in the region where epidemiological studies
can never establish excess risk estimates significantly abose
zero. Certainly. the contribution of random error at the
current sta« of analysis is not at all clear.
For this reason it is important to develop other techniques
which might help establish a figure with greater accuracy.
More and better controlled studies help to do this, but so do
indirect inferential methods such as the cotinine marker app-
roach. it is therefore of considerable value that the different
approaches appear to be reconcilable, rather than leaving
open a subjective judgement of which to accept.
The comments of Professors John Eceirston and IAD Saunders. and
the input from referees. have sharpened cons.derabt) our treatment

You may be interested in the attached paper, "The EPA's Use of Science," which B&W recently
produced. It addresses primarily the EPA's treatment of ETS, and also alar and dioxin to
present a rounded case that the EPA misuses science to support positions consistent with
environmentalist and anti-smoking advocates.

THE EPA'S UNE OF SCIgNCE
Almost since its creation, the regulatory decisions
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
have been widely criticized. Some of this criticism is the
result of the politicized nature of the complex and important
issues which the agency is charged with regulating. Nearly
every decision the EPA makes can impose significant costs on
taxpayers, industry, or the environment, and it would be odd
if those decisions were not often hotly debated. This debate
has, however, focused in many instances not on the policy
choices which EPA eight make, but on the poor quality of EPA's
scientific decision-making.
The charge from many quarters is that EPA misuses
science. Decisions frequently are not based on an even-
handed, careful and thorough study or review of the evidence,
but instead are result-oriented, poorly researched and
studied, and frequently flaw frost the refusal or failure to
follow basic and well-accepted scientific techniques. These
problems have been identified by expert panels of the EPA,I/

either that no conclusion can be reached or that ETS Is not a
carcinogen.
I. THX XT S RI SZ ASSESSMENT
On January 7, 1993, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) released a report in which it claimed that
environmental tobacco smoke should be classified as a "Group
A" or "known human" carcinogen, that exposure to ETS is
associated with 3,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the U.S.
and that ETS exposure is associated with a variety of effects
in children. The ETS risk assessment violates widely accepted
scientific standards in a number of respects. It also com-
pletely abandons the EPA's own carefully considered guidelines
for assessment of carcinogens. These deficiencies raise
questions about the agency's commitment to good science.
A. EPA FAILED TO rouow AGENCY GUIDELINES
In preparing the ETS Risk Assessment, EPA failed to
adhere to its guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment in two
fundamental respects.
1. Comparisons of Active Smoking to ETS Expogure
EPA concluded in its report that ETS could be
classified as a known human carcinogen solely on the basis of
comparisons with data on active smoking. In reviewing a prior
draft of the report, EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) told
the agency that this would not be appropriate. That judgment
was ignored in the final version of the report.
566406017

- 4 -
Such an extrapolation from one substance to another
ly wholly uniustified and sets a very danoerous precedent.
Exposure to ETS is In fact considerably different from the
exposures to tobacco smoke experienced by smokers. For one
thing, exposure levels of ETS are thousands of times lower
than for active smoking. A recent publication estimated the
typical ETS exposure of the U.S. population to be around the
equivalent of a single cigarette per yr. Moreover, ETS and
mainstream smoke are significantly different in their chemical
and physical properties and in the way in which people are
exposed to them.
If this enormous leap from active smoking to ETS
were valid, then, to be logically consistent, diesel exhausts,
wood fires at home, cooking fumes, and gas fires (to name a
few examples) would need to be classified as known human
carcinogens, based on apparent similarities in their chemical
make-up to industrial emissions of coke ovens, which are
already classified by EPA as Group A carcinogens.
2. Epidemiologic studies
EPA also stated in its report that epidemiologic
studies of ETS exposure support the conclusion of carcino-
genicity. The studies that EPA reviewed compared the
incidence of lung cancer in nonsmoking women married to
smokers with that in nonsmoking women married to nonsmokers.
Around thirty such studies have been reported. Over two-
thirds of these studies reported no "statistically signifi-
5664060/S
• •0!+.•:.'

- 5 -
cant" results, which to theacientist means that they are
Inconclusive ai to whether there really is an increased risk
for ETS exposure. And all of the studies, including the few
that produced any statistically significant results, failed
adequately to account for other possible factors that could
explain the results. Yet EPA ignored this, despite the fact
that EPA guidelines provide that in order for evidence from
such studies to be adequate, the agency must show that there
is no factor other than ETS that could explain reports of
increased risk in the studies. EPA failed to account properly
for several conditions that may occur in smokers' families
more than in nonsmokers' families, such as poor diet, inferior
medical care, and lower general socioeconomic status. Without
such an accounting, the study results do not demonstrate that
ETS exposure has even a statistical association with lung
cancer incidence, let alone a causal relationship.
B. EPA MANIPULATED TEE STATISTICAL STANDARD
Each of the human epidemiologic studies considered
by EPA is a statistical evaluation of whether exposure to ETS
might be associated with lung cancer. These studies basically
are polls that assess whether nonsmoking woeen married to
smokers tend to be more likely to get lung cancer than those
not married to smokers. As in any poll, there is a margin of
error. For example, the results of political polls typically
are reported with a margin of error that is five points either
way. That is, if candidate A polls 52% and candidate B polls
6,106019

- 6 -
48%, i.e., a 4-point separation, then with the margin of error
of 5 points either way the race is effectively "too close to
call" or a wdead heat." In fact, precisely the same margin of
error is applied to the human studies of ETS -- 5 points
either way, or, as the scientists say, a "95% confidence
interval." Ninety-five percent is the standard test. It is
used in the original research papers on ETS, in previous EPA
risk assessments, and, in fact, in the original draft of the
agency's ETS risk assessment.
Ninety-five percent is not, however, used in the EPA
report. Rather, EPA reduced the confidence test to 90t. When
questioned, EPA staffers stated that this was valid since they
had a prior "feeling" that ETS would cause lung cancer.
This doctoring of the standard has an important
effect. At the accepted standard of 95%, all of the U.S.
studies of Els exposure in the home and lung cancer are
statistically not significant -- they are "dead heats" or "too
close to call." Only when the standard is changed does one of
the eleven studies reviewed by EPA become statistically
significant. To have to resort to manipulation of the numbers
(or, as one agency staffer conceded in a press interview,
"fancy statistical footwork") to prove a prior "feeling" (or
perhaps more accurately, a preordained agency position) is . •:
scientifically indefensible.
566406020

- 7 -
C. THE REPORT WAS OBSOLETE BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED
Even moving the goal posts by altering the
statistical standard ultimately does not support EPA's
conclusion. Several months before the release of the final
document, the results of the largeSt Study ever conducted on
ETS exposure and lung cancer, which was sponsored by the
National cancer Institute (NCI), were published. The study
reported no association between ETS exposure and lung cancer
at home, in the workplace or in social settings. When this
report is added to the other U.S. studies, the summary result
Is statistically not significant (at both 90% and 95%
confidence levels) -- that is, the results again are a "dead
heat." It in thus not possible to toll on the basis of the
epidemiologic studies whether ETS is or is not associated with
lung cancer.
Curiously, EPA supplied a brief addendum to its
report in which it said that it had looked at this new study
but then did not include it on the basis that it was somehow
generally Consistent with the overall findings of the agency
risk estimate. This conclusion is simply incomprehensible.
The responsible course clearly would have been to factor into
the summary result the data from the latest and largest -- and
federally funded -- U.S. study.
D. THE ESTIMATE OF DEATHS IS UNCERTAIN
EPA claims a "medium to high" certainty that
exposure to ETS is associated with around 3,000 lnng cancer
566406021

- 8 -
deaths in the U.S. each year. The agency's Science Advisory
Board concluded that any such estimate is definitely not of
medium to high certainty, and that because of the numerous
assumptions necessary for the estimate it was important that
EPA not Create a false sense of security in its estimate. The
SAB also recommended the removal of ex-smokers from the
estimate, which would remove around 1,000 deaths from the
claimed total. EPA ignored both of these points. Even EPA,
however, has acknowledged that the lower bound of estimated
risk may be as few as 700 deaths. In fact, the lower bound
would include zero if EPA had taken into account the inherent
uncertainties in its assessment.
EPA has gone to some lengths to create an aura of
scientific certainty for its estimate. In fact, the EPA
estimate is the result of a series of torturous mathematical
equations that are replete with assumptions. The calculations
and description of the assumptions alone take up 32 pages of
the report.
The linchpin to the mortality estimate is, of
course, the assumption that ETS causes lung cancer in the
first place. The estimate is based on the U.S. studies, all
of which under the usual scientific standards are "dead
heats." When the NCI-sponsored study and other subsequent
studies are considered, the summary of the studies is also a
"dead heat." Thus, there is no basis for making an estimate
of deaths. At the very least, EPA should have stated that the
566406022

- 9 -
conclusion that exposure to ETS results in no lung cancer
deaths is statistically just as likely as any other
conclusion.
E. DATA ON WOREPLACE:EKPOSIRE IS IGRONED
EPA reviewed only studies that considered Women's
recall of exposure to ETS from a husband smoking at home. It
ignored the fourteen studies that have reported data on
workplace exposure to ETS. Twelve of these fourteen,
Including the largest case-control study ever conducted,
reported no statistically Significant association.
F. TEE EXTENT OF IF 15 EXAGGERATED
Even if one assumes -- incorrectly, as shown above
-- that ETS exposure has been shown to increase the risk of
lung cancer, EPA has made alarmist statements about the extent
of this risk. The former EPA Administrator claimed that, on
the basis of this report, ETS presents a risk ten times
greater than any substance that the agency regulates. This is
hardly in line with the comments of the Chairman of the EPA's
Science Advisory Board, who suggested in an interview that the
risk from exposure to ETS may be about the same as the risk
from exposure to traffic in Washington, D.C.
G. ZCIENCE WM_BASED ON A PREDETERMINE') AGENCY POLICY
In preparing the ETS risk assessment, EPA flouted
its own guidelines, lowered statistical standards, claimed
false certainty, and ignored essential information. For these
566406023

- 10 -
reasons, the report appears to be little more than a political
statement cloaked in the mantle of science.
II. CREDIBLE SCIENCE, CREDIBLE DECISIONS
The ITS risk assessment is by no means the first to
raise questions over the way in which EPA uses or misuses
science to reach preconceived policy aims. In fact, criticism
of the quality of EPA's science has been so significant that
in early 1991, the former EPA Administrator commissioned an
external scientific review panel to investigate the agency's
procedures. This panel issued a report in March of 1992
entitled "Safeguarding the Future: Credible Science, Credible
Decisions." One of the expert panel's most striking
conclusions is that there is a widespread perception that EPA
science is adjusted to fit policy. As discussed below, the
ITS risk assessment is only one of many examples of the
agency's tendency to let politics and media headlines drive
science at EPA.
A. THE_ALAR IN APPLES CONTROVERSY
What is now referred to as the "Alar scare" began in
1989 with a CBS '60 Minutes" story that claimed that this
chemical, used in orchards to slow the ripening of apples,
caused cancer. EPA added fuel to the fire by announcing that
the interim results of an ongoing review suggested that Alar
was a probable carcinogen and should be banned from food. The
result of this declaration was a dramatic reduction in the
566406024

- 11 -
sale of apples. In fact, one judge later said that "apples
had not received such bad press since Genesis."
This was not the first time that EPA had addressed
Alar. In 1985, EPA took its first steps towards proposing a
ban on the use of Alar, but was rebuffed by the agency's
Science Advisory Panel, which concluded that the scientific
basis for such a proposal was too flimsy. This recommendation
did not, however, stop EPA from assigning Alar a carcino-
genicity potency factor. EPA then initiated sore animal
studies on Alar. These studies were under way when the "60
Minutes" story, stimulated in part by the environmental group,
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), branded Alar as
a potent carcinogen. MRDC claimed that one in every four
thousand pre-school children was likely to get cancer as a
result of the use of Alar. EPA's support of MRDC's claim of
carcinogenicity through the release of an interim report of an
animal study clearly contributed to the decision by
manufacturers of Ala' to withdraw their product in 1989.
This was not, however, the end of the story. Later,
when the animal study was completed, EPA's estimate of risk
had to be halved. Moreover, many scientists believed that the
evidence from EPA's study was not consistent with any cancer
riak. Both the World Health Organization and the British
Government reviewed the evidence and concluded that the levels
of Alar found on apples and other foods were safe.
566406025

- 12 -
In the aftermath of the controversy, the then U.S.
Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, stated that "Alar never did
pose a health threat." Dr. Elizabeth Whelan of the American
Council on Science and Health said, "The Alar scare is but one
sorry example of what can happen when politics and hysteria
prevail over science in determining alleged human cancer
risks." Dr. Ralph Reed of the American Medical Association
commented that "The Alas scare . . . shows what happens when
science is taken out of context or the risks of a product are
blown out of all proportion."
Despite much criticism, EPA has never withdrawn its
claim that Alar is a carcinogen, and Alar still is not used on
food in the United States.
B. proxim
The controversy over whether exposure to the
chemical dioxin causes cancer has endured for over two
decades. In the early 1980s, EPA determined dioxin to be a
possible human carcinogen. Since then, dioxin, which is
ubiquitous in the environment, has commonly been portrayed as
one of the most potent carcinogens known to man.
In 1982 and 1983, the federal government spent $33
million to buy the town of Times Beach, Missouri, and relocate
its 2,240 residents because it claimed that the streets of the
town had been contaminated with dioxin. The government's
action was the result of EPA claims about the carcinogenic
566406026

- 13 -
potential of dioxin, which were based solely on studies in
animals.
Over the past several years, a number of scientists
have noted that few human studiez have been able to
demonstrate an effect from dioxin, particularly at the low
levels to which the general population is expoeed. Citing
biological differences between animals and humane, and the
difficulty of compaing high doses in test animal with low
doses in humans, these scientists believe that dioxin
exposures at low levels are unlikely to cause cancer in
humans.
After considerable debate over several years, EPA
finally agreed that it may have exaggerated the dioxin problem
and is currently revising its assessment. The reassessment,
in its latest draft form, concludes that humans are not as
likely to develop cancer from tiny amounts of dioxin as once
believed. At a talk to agency staffers in November 1982,
Dr. Erich Bretthauer, the head of EPA research, conceded that
EPA's treatment of the dioxin scare had been an expensive
mistake,
C.  Auscy or ATTORNEYS
Even EPA now acknowledges that it had made a number
of scientific mistakes. EPA research director Dr. Erich
Bretthauer has said that "EPA has been an agency of attorneys.
I don't think the organization has had enough respect for
science."
56E1406027

- 14 -
Dr. Bretthauer went on to acknowledge that in some
past cases EPA had paid more attention to media headlines than
scientific findings. He stated further that the government
has forced billions of dollars of needless expense in cleaning
out asbestos, which in many cases would have boon better left
alone.
There are other examples. EPA has claimed that the
radioactive gas radon, found in many homes in the United
States, is responsible for between 5,000 and 20,000 lung
cancer deaths per year in the U.S. EPA continues to run media
campaigns on the dangers of radon. Yet radon does not appear
on EPA's carcinogen list. More recently, EPA has warned
people against taking showers at home, suggesting that
showering can increase exposure to chlorinated chemicals. EPA
also has claimed -- on the basis of computer models employing
highly questionable assumptions -- that for every one percent
reduction in the ozone layer there will be a 3 percent _
increase in nonmelanoma skin cancers. In each case, EPA has
rushed to fan the flames of public hysteria over supposed
environmental threats well in advance of a strong scientific
foundation that would support those claims.
III. CONCLUSION
Despite frequent acknowledgements Within EPA that
mistakes are being made, that priorities are wrong, and that
politics is driving the science, the ETS risk assessment
indicates that there has been no real effort by the agency to
566406028

- IS -
refora its approach to science. EPA's mandate to clean up the
nation's air, water, and waste enjoys public support. But
unless the agency decides to get serious about implementing
the racommendations of CredIDIa Science, public confidence In
EPA will continue to erode.

Abstract
Although epidemiological studies suggest that cigarette
smoking is a risk factor for cervical cancer, further
evidence is required to document the biological
plausibility ot this relationship. This study obtained
cervical mucus, using a tervical flush technique, from
511 patients in a neoplasia clinic. Nicotine was detected
in the cervical mucus of all 25 smokers and ((Amine in
the mucus of 84% of the smokers; nicotine and
cntinine levels were correlated (P 0.10) with both the
number of cigarettes usually smoked and the number
smoked in the last 24 h. Nicotine and cotinine levels fur
passive smokers and nonexposed women were much
lower than for women who currently smoked, with
little difference found between the nonsmoking women
who did and did not report passive smoke exposure. In
the one woman who reported smokeless tobacco use,
both nicotine and colinine were detected at much
higher levels than for other nonsmoking women. These
results indicate that tobacco constituents do indeed
reach the uterine cervix, suggesting that they could
play a causal role in the development of cervical
cancer.

such as nicotine and cotinme, have been isolated in the

that nicotine can be mtrosated in vivo to carcinogenic

FOREWORD
Current Intelligence Bulletins (Cs) are issued by the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (N1OSH). Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, to dis.seminate
new scientific information about occupational hazards. A CM may draw attention to a
formerly unrecognized hazard, report new data en a {mown hazard. or dissertunate infor-
mation on hazard control.
CIEs are distributed to representatives of academia. industry, organized labor, public health
agencies. and public interest groups, as well as to Federal agencies responsible for ensuring
the safer' and health of workers.
Copies are available to individuals upon request from the Division of Standards Develop-
ment and Technology Transfer, N10514 (Robert A. Taft Labora tones. 4676 Columbia
Park-way, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226). We welcome suggestions concerning the content, style,
and distribution of these documents.
The purpose of this bulletin is to disseminate information about the potential risk of cancer
to workers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In 1964, the Surgeon General
issued the first report on smoking and health, which concluded that cigarette smoking causes
lung cancer. Skim tier, research on the toxicity and carcinogeniciry of tobacco smoke has
demonstrated that the health risk from inhaling tobacco smoke is not limited to the smoker.
but also includes those who inhale ETS. ETS contains many of the toxic agents and
carcinogens that are present in mainstream smoke, but in diluted form. Recent
epidemioiogic studies support and reinforce earlier published reviews by the Surgeon
General and the National Research Council demonstrating that exposure to ETS can cause
lung cancer. These mviews estimated the relative risk of lung cancer to be a pprordmately
1.3 for a nonsmoker living with a smoker compared with a nonsmoker living with a
nonsmoker. In addition, recent evidence also suggests a possible association between
exposure to ETS and an increased risk of heart Ili v-ntr in nonsmokers. Although these data
were not gathered to an occupational sertng, ETS meets the criteria of the Occupauonal
Safety and Smith Administration (OSHA) for classification as a potential occupational
carcinogen (Title 29 of the Code of Federal Reguiarions, Part 1990]. :sTIOSH therefore
conders ETS to be a potential occupational carcinogen and recommends that exposures
be reduced to the lowest feasible concentration. AU available preventive measures should
be used to rninimi70 occupational exposure to rrs.
566406034

NIOSH urges employers to disseminate this information to employees. NTOSH also
requests diet professional and trade associations and unions inform their members about
the potential hazards of exposure to ETS. Readers seeking more detailed information about
the studies cited in this bulletin are urged to consult the original kblications.

ABSTRACT
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (N1OSH) has deterrathed that
environmental tobacco smoke lETS) is potentially carcinogenic to occupanonally exposed
workers- In 1964, the Surgeon General issued the fusx report on smoking and health, which
concluded that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer. Since then, research on the toxicity and
carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke has demonstrated that the health risk from inhaling
tobacco smoke is not limited to the smoker, but also includes those who inhale ETS. ETS
contains many of the toxic agents and carcinogens that are present in mainstream smoke,
but in diluted form. Recent epiclemiologic studies support and reinforce earlier published
reviews by the Surgeon General and the National Research Council demonstrating that
exposure to EIS can cause lung cancer. These reviews estimated the relative risk of lung
canter to be approximately 1.3 Iota nonsmoker living with a smoker compared with a
nonsmoker living with a nonsmoker. In addition, recent evidence suggests a possdble
association between exposure of nonsmokersto ETS and an increased risk of heart
Although these data were not gathered in an occupational seining, ETS meets the criteria of
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for classifying substances as
potential occupational carcinogens (Tule 29 of the Code of Federal &gull:awns. Part 1990).
N1OSH therefore recommends that ETS be regarded as a potential occupational carcinogen
in conformance with the OSHA carcinogen policy, and that exposures W ETS be reduced
to the lowest feasible concentration. Employers should minimize occupational exposure
to ETS by using all available preventive measures.
