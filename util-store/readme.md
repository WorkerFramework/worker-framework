# util-store

---

 This subproject contains useful utility components for use when storing data
 assets in DataStores.


## StoreUtil

 This class contains utility methods that hash data assets as they are being
 stored in a DataStore. The results of these methods are instances of `HashStoreResult`.
 
 
## HashStoreResult

 This class holds the result of hashing a data asset as it is being stored
 in a DataStore. It includes the storage reference to the stored data, which
 can be used subsequently to retrieve the asset, and a SHA-1 hash of the stored data.
