### Components of a Worker

The following modules are required to create a worker. Each contains its own pom.xml with its own dependencies and plugins:

- `worker-example-shared` module contains objects shared between the worker and consumers. It forms an interface to the worker.
	1. **ExampleWorkerResult** – The result generated by the worker. Results are serialized and sent to the RabbitMQ queue specified in the rabbit configuration.
	2. **ExampleWorkerTask** – The main point of entry used to communicate with the worker. Tasks are serialized and sent to the worker via the configured queue on RabbitMQ.
	3. **ExampleWorkerStatus** – Records the status of the worker result.
	4. **ExampleWorkerConstants** - Defines the public constant variables.
- `worker-example` module contains the worker itself, closely related classes and markdown document with information about the worker.
	1. **ExampleWorker** – Responsible for doing the work. AbstractWorker is the preferable base class for a worker in most scenarios.
	2. **ExampleWorkerConfiguration** – Holds configuration parameters for execution of the worker. These are read in from an ExampleWorkerConfiguration JSON file and used within the worker's execution.
	3. **ExampleWorkerFactory** – Creates a worker, extends AbstractWorkerFactory.
	4. **ExampleWorkerFactoryProvider** - Creates a worker factory, extends WorkerFactoryProvider.
	5. **ExampleWorkerHealthCheck** - Provides a basic health check for marathon GUI display, implements HealthReporter.
- `worker-example-container` builds the docker image for the worker. It has two submodules named build and test. The **build** module is responsible for building the docker image of the worker and pushing the image to docker. The **test** module is responsible for starting a container for RabbitMQ, test-configs and the worker, and running the integration tests. These tests runs locally and send task messages to the worker via RabbitMQ. It waits for a response from the worker, which will be published by the worker and retrieved from the configured queue.
	1. **build**
		1. **pom.xml** - Specifies the docker maven plugin and configurations to build the image for the worker
	2. **test**
		1. **pom.xml** - Specifies maven compiler and failsafe plugin for compiling and running integration tests, docker maven plugin to run containers for RabbitMQ, the test-configs and the worker.
		2. **ExampleWorkerResultPreparationProvider** – Creates test items, extends PreparationItemProvider or some subclass of ContentFilesTestItemProvider.
		3. **ExampleWorkerTestControllerProvider** – Provides classes required for test execution, extends AbstractTestControllerProvider.
		4. **ExampleWorkerTestExpectation** – Test item expected output for comparison with actual output, extends ContentFileTestExpectation.
		5. **ExampleWorkerTestInput** – Test item input, extends FileTestInputData.
		6. **ExampleWorkerResultValidationProcessor** – Validates that the expected result and returned worker result are the same/as expected, extends AbstractResultProcessor or one of its subclasses.
		7. **ExampleWorkerSaveResultProcessor** – Generates test data, extends ContentResultProcessor or a subclass of PreparationResultProcessor.
		8. **ExampleWorkerTaskFactory** – Creates worker tasks, extends FileInputWorkerTaskFactory.

### Using the Worker Archetypes

A Maven Archetype is a template upon which you can base a project.

Excerpt from [Apache Maven Archetype Introduction](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html) :

<pre>"Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit.
An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made."</pre>

#### Maven Archetypes for Worker projects

You can create the foundations of a new worker project by using the available worker archetypes:

- `worker-shared-archetype`
- `worker-archetype`
- `worker-container-archetype`

The Example Worker projects were used to base these Worker Archetype projects upon and so the generation of a new project from these Worker Archetypes will contain the same functionality as the Example Worker.

It performs a text conversion on a text file based on an `Action` enumeration passed in from the `ExampleWorkerTask` class. It retrieves the text from a data source and returns a result message containing either a reference to the result in the `DataStore` or the result itself.

#### Creating a new Worker from Worker Archetypes

A new worker will have common module properties:

- GroupID
- Version
- Package
- WorkerName

The following subsections provide instructions on how you can use Maven Command Line Interface (CLI), IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or NetBeans IDE to create the components of a worker from worker archetypes.

##### Maven CLI

The Maven CLI offers developers the ability to generate projects from archetypes with the `mvn archetype:generate` command. The location where you run the command is where the projects are created.

###### 1. Generate the New Worker's Shared Module

Generate the new worker's shared module from the `worker-shared-archetype` with the following Maven command:

<pre>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://cbgmaven.hpeswlab.net/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots -DarchetypeVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=worker-shared-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=com.hpe.caf.worker</pre>

The CLI will prompt you for groupId, version (default suggestion is 1.0-SNAPSHOT), package (default suggestion is the groupId, you should, however, adjust this to include the worker's purpose) and workerName properties required for the new shared project. The artifactId should be distinct for this module's purpose. See Figure 1.

![Generate Example Worker Shared Module from CLI](images/CLIGenerateExampleShared.png)
*Figure 1*

If you are satisfied with the properties you have set, confirm them by typing 'Y'. Otherwise type 'N' or any other character to re-enter property values. After confirming your properties Maven will generate the new worker's shared module. Take note of these property names for the generation of the worker back-end module.

###### 2. Generate the New Worker's Back-end Module

Generate the new worker's back-end project from the `worker-archetype` with the following Maven command:

<pre>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://cbgmaven.hpeswlab.net/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots -DarchetypeVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=worker-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=com.hpe.caf.worker</pre>

The CLI will prompt you for the worker's common properties; groupId, version (default suggestion is 1.0-SNAPSHOT), package (default suggestion is the groupId, you should, however, adjust this to the package property value you set in the shared module) and workerName. The artifactId should be distinct for this module's purpose. In addition, the back-end module archetype will prompt you for the name of the worker shared module's artifactId property that you set in the previous step. See Figure 2.

![Generate Example Worker Backend Module from CLI](images/CLIGenerateExampleBackend.png)
*Figure 2*

If you are satisfied with the properties you have set, confirm them by typing 'Y'. Otherwise, type 'N' or any other character to re-enter property values. After confirming your properties, Maven will generate the new worker's Back-end module. Take note of these property names for the generation of the worker container module.

###### 3. Generate the New Worker's Container Module

Generate the new worker's container project from the `worker-container-archetype` with the following Maven command:

<pre>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://cbgmaven.hpeswlab.net/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots -DarchetypeVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=worker-container-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=com.hpe.caf.worker</pre>

The CLI will prompt you for the worker's common properties; groupId, version (default suggestion is 1.0-SNAPSHOT), package (default suggestion is the groupId, you should, however, adjust this to the package property value you set in the shared module) and workerName. The artifactId should be distinct to this module's purpose. In addition, the container module archetype will prompt you for the name of the worker back-end module's artifactId property that you set in the previous step. See Figure 3.

![Generate Example Worker Container Module from CLI](images/CLIGenerateExampleContainer.png)
*Figure 3*

If you are satisfied with the properties you have set, confirm these by typing 'Y'. Otherwise, type 'N' or any other character to re-enter property values. After confirming your properties Maven will generate the new worker's container module.

Due to a bug with the Apache Maven Archetype, some place-holders that are preceded with underscores are not replaced. A manual step is required that you replace these manually. In the generated container project `.../configuration/marathon-template-config` and `.../test-configs` folders include container configuration files that with left over place-holders within their file names. Replace all occurrences of `__workerArtifactId__` with the name of the Worker Back-end module's artifactId property (workerArtifactId). See the **Renaming Container Marathon Configuration Files** and **Renaming Container Test Configuration Files** table in the Appendix.
